Dante Curry: Hello, Hello, I'm Dante Curry.
Elijah Sanchez: And I'm Elijah Sanchez.
Dante Curry: And we are here today conducting an interview 
by phone. We are here in Denton, Texas talking to 
Juanita Harris in Norman, Oklahoma. Juanita is 
going to tell us a little bit about her early 
life on an Oklahoma farm. If you want to say 
hello?
Juanita Harris: Hello, this is Juanita Harris.
Dante Curry: Alright, Juanita, if you'll tell us a little 
bit about your childhood, where did you grow up?
Juanita Harris: I grew up in Cleveland County, Norman, 
Oklahoma area.
Dante Curry: Mhm, and how long did you live there?
Juanita Harris: Till I was nineteen -- no, till I was about 
twenty-four years old.
Dante Curry: Mhm -- How big was your family?
Juanita Harris: I had seven brothers and sisters.
Dante Curry: Um... And, you told me that -- you told me that 
you lived on a farm till you got married. 
Juanita Harris: Yes.
Dante Curry: At that point did you move out? Have you lived 
on a farm anytime afterwards?
Harris: No
Sanchez: Could you tell us a little bit about the farm? 
Like, how was it like or what did y'all do on the 
farm?
Harris: We just do -- did a lot things in farm life at that 
time. Growing our food, our cattle that we had, 
would eat. butcher them and eat them, and just 
live like normal people at that time. 
Curry: How like big was the farm? Like how much land would 
you say y'all had?
Harris: Well, my mother, daddy did not own the property. 
So, we rented from about 160 acres and a lot of 
that was wooded acres. It was not all of it 
farmland. 
Sanchez: Mmm, and like what kind of like cattle would you, 
like, raise?
Harris: I'm sorry?
Sanchez: What kind of cattle did y'all raise?
Harris: Just different kinds. We didn't have a certain 
breed of cattle that we used. It was just all a 
mix of kind.
Curry: How many did you have?
Harris: Probably 20, 25, 30 at the most.
Sanchez and Curry: Oh wow.
Curry: Go ahead.
Sanchez: What kind of things would y'all grow?
Harris: We grew all kinds of vegetables on the farm for 
eating like, course we had to grow corn and hay 
for the cattle to eat. But the vegetables were 
potatoes, green beans, corn, squash, cucumbers, 
watermelons. Just about anything that you can 
think of that was known at that time.
Sanchez: Mm.
Curry: Wow, that was a lot of different stuff. [laughs]
Harris: [laughs] Yes, it was a lot of work.
Curry: Yeah, and what were your responsibilities on the 
farm?
Harris: As a child, we didn't have that many 
responsibilities because some of the things were 
not for children to do. But the things we could 
do would be like, help our mother and dad with 
the chores that was needed at for the kids to do, 
like feeding the chickens, gathering the eggs, 
helping with getting the cattle into the 
barnyard. Just things like that that children 
could help to do.
Curry: Did you have maybe older siblings that had other 
responsibilities? 
Harris: No, I was the oldest in the family. 
Curry: Then what sorts of things did maybe your parents 
have to do that you and your siblings were not 
entrusted with?
Harris: Well, daddy would have to do the hay. Like cutting 
the hay, breaking the hay, the grass to be made 
into hay for the cattle. So he would cut it, mow 
it and bale it, into bales that were... they were 
not big for daddy or an adult to do, but for 
children they were too heavy to pick up. And then 
they had to haul them from the hay field to the 
barn, and stack them in a covered area where they 
would be protected through the fall and winter. 
And then just some other things that were too 
dangerous for children to do. We weren't always 
involved in everything.
Curry: Sorry, we are going over our questions.
Sanchez: Yeah.
Curry: I don't know, I'll stay on this topic for a moment, 
umm. You said that there were other 
responsibilities that were maybe too dangerous 
for y'all. What sorts of responsibilities?
Harris: Well, just like doing the hay, a lot of times the 
cattle would be too big for us to be around, you 
know as children, and so we weren't really 
allowed when we were real young to be around the 
cattle that much. But as we grew and sometimes 
whenever daddy would need help with milking, my 
brother -- who was about a year younger than I am 
-- he and I would have to do -- help dad with the 
milking sometimes. Just little things like that, 
that you wouldn't want to be around the hay work 
and some of the cattle because some of them could 
get dangerous around the children.
Sanchez: For sure.
Curry: Yeah, I understand. Did you -- work with growing the 
vegetables at all? Or was that something your 
parents handled?
Harris: Oh no, we had to help with that because that was 
something we could do. Because you could be out 
in the open garden, and you know planting the 
seeds, our parents would show us how to plant 
them. Then of course they would help us, as the 
plants were growing we had to help chop -- what 
they call chop the garden which was making sure 
we keep the weeds and grasses out of the garden 
so the vegetables could grow alone. And then 
whenever the vegetables got to be big enough, 
read -- ready to be harvested, then we would go 
pick the beans, and cucumbers, tomatoes, whatever 
needed to be picked at that time and helped with 
that. 
Sanchez: How big of a garden would you say y'all had? Was 
it like a huge like -- like farmland or just like 
a small little area?
Harris: No it was not like farmland. I would say all 
together there was no more than like an acre.
Sanchez: Okay.
Harris: Because we would have the beans, and then 
watermelons, and the cantaloupes, cucumbers, and 
they needed space to grow because they grew on 
vines, so they would need -- no it was not a huge 
farm garden, it was more so a local, you know, 
family garden.
Sanchez: Like so what kind of tools would y'all use to help 
you grow, like any machinery or fertilizers?
Harris: Most of it, at that time, a great deal of it was 
done by hand. Because we didn't have the modern 
things that are available today. We would have to 
use a hoe, a shovel, and my daddy would have to 
use a little, what they called a plow, which he 
would brought behind and just push and then open 
up a row, and that's how we would plant the 
seeds. And just like I said, hoeing when using 
the hoe, and digging the potatoes when they were 
ready to be dug, we would do that by hand, using 
the shovel, so. We didn't have the modern things 
that are available now.
Sanchez: Mm.
Curry: When you said you were growing things in the garden, 
you said that some of the plants needed a lot of 
space. Were there any like, were there any crops 
that needed maybe particular considerations, like 
if you had to plant them a different way? 
Anything like that?
Harris: Yes, the potatoes you would plant on what they 
called a hill. Daddy would pull dirt up from both 
sides of the row and kind of make a little hill 
down through there. And especially the 
watermelons and cucumbers and cantaloupes and 
sweet potatoes, needed to be, the soil needed to 
be prepared like that before you planted them 
because they needed the hill so they could grow 
down a little bit.
Curry: So, once you had harvested all of this, was all of 
this food to eat? Would you sell some of it? What 
did you do with it?
Harris: Most of it was to eat. We would share it with 
family and friends, and daddy he was very good at 
growing watermelons, and his reputation for 
growing the watermelons was well known around 
this area so he would sell some of the 
watermelons, but that's about mostly what we ever 
sold. Sometimes if we had extra corn we would 
sell the- what they call the ears of corn, the 
fresh corn, we would sell that. But the 
watermelons, mostly what we sold was the 
watermelons.
Sanchez: The community y'all grew up in, was it all pretty 
much like just a bunch of little farms and 
gardens as well?
Harris: Yes.
Sanchez: Okay, did y'all ever like, I don't know, interact 
with other farms or help each other or what not?
Harris: Yes, especially at harvest time, whenever things 
needed to come in on a certain time, if you let 
them go too long then it was what they called 
"passed" and then yes, we would have to help each 
other. A lot of things like that.
Sanchez: How big would you say this community was?
Harris: Well it would just be neighbors. Probably no more 
than four or five neighbors, close by neighbors, 
and you didn't always have close by neighbors. 
Some of the places we lived, it would be a half a 
mile, three-quarters a mile in between houses. 
Sometimes even further than that. Most of the 
time it would be someone you knew well and had 
known for years.
Sanchez: Mhm. Okay.
Curry: When we had talked about this a little bit before 
the interview, you told us a little bit about the 
process of preserving food, could you go over 
that again?
Harris: Go ahead.
Curry: Oh, could -- could you tell us about how you 
preserved food?
Harris: Yes, in most everything we preserved, which was 
mostly vegetables and a few fruits, there was a 
process called "hot bath wash" and that's how you 
would cook -- more or less, heat your water 
really, really high and hot, and then you would 
prepare the food by putting it in the jars, and 
then you put it down in that hot water bath, and 
cook it for about twenty minutes at least. And 
then take it out and let it cool. And then 
preparing for your, for your like your green 
beans, you would pick your green beans from the 
garden, you would clean them, you would snap them 
(which was breaking them up in one to two inch 
pieces) and then you would put them in a jar, and 
put a hot brine solution, which would be a little 
bit of salt and vinegar and whatever, which would 
help preserve once they were in the jar. And then 
you would put a lid on it that had a rubber seal, 
in that hot water bath, would allow the rubber 
seal, heat up. And once it cooled, then it would 
tighten the lid and seal the lid, or the rubber 
liner thing in it. And then that's how it was 
preserved. And you did that with almost 
everything that you preserved, the roots, the 
vegetables, which would be green beans, corn, 
potatoes, peaches, anything like that, plums, 
that you wanted to preserve that way.
Curry: That's really interesting. That sounds a little bit 
like canning things. Did -- did you ever pickle 
anything? Did you ever pickle anything?
Harris: Yes, we did.
Sanchez: I was thinking the same thing.
Harris: My mother would pickle the cucumbers, of course, 
and different kind of pickles. She would make 
what we would call the "bread and butter chips" 
we have now. She would use the larger pickles to 
do that. She would cut them into slices and put 
onions in it, and sometimes peppers, little hot 
peppers in there, then she would have a vinegar, 
sugar brine stuff she would pour on those, and 
then the same way you would a hot water bath. But 
when you're making dill pickles, or whatever, you 
had to put them in what they called crocks, which 
was a large container, thick container... made out 
of, I don't know for sure what it was made out 
of. Certainly wasn't plastic, but they called it 
a crock. And it had a wide opening on it, you'd 
put your pickles down in there, and you'd put the 
salt water bath on that cold and then put a rock 
or plate on top of that to keep the pickles 
pushed down. Then they would have to sit for 
several days, sometimes a week or so in what was 
called pickling. And then take them out of that 
solution at the time they were ready to be 
canned, you would take them out of that, that 
conditioning area there and then you would put 
them in the jars, and put your pickling solution 
and whatever it was, if it was dill you would 
have your dill in it, if it were sweet pickles 
you'd have a lot of sugar and vinegar and stuff. 
And then you would pour over the pickles in the 
jar, put the lid on it like before, and then 
again put them in the hot water bath for a 
certain amount of time. So it took longer to do 
pickles than just your beans or your peaches or 
whatever you were canning at the time. And mom, 
at one time or two I remember her making 
sauerkraut, and you'd have it to do it about the 
same way. You'd have to put it in the crock, and 
let it more or less ferment to a certain degree, 
then take it out, rinse it, and then put your 
brine -- whatever you were gonna pickle it in -- 
in that jar, and then cook your -- put it in the 
hot water bath for a certain amount of time 
needed for that.
Sanchez and Curry: Mm.
Curry: Now like -- go ahead, go ahead.
Harris: It's interesting, whenever you look back at it now, 
Dante, it was interesting. But at the time it was 
work. [laughs]
Curry: [laughs] Oh yeah. And of course, sauerkraut, bread 
and butter pickles, these are things I think 
about and expect to see at the grocery store. 
Harris: Yes.
Curry: But something else I wanted to ask about is, you 
grew a whole bunch of different foods. What sorts 
of meals would you all prepare with them?
Harris: Just about what you have for today. I mean like we 
had our own meat, which mom would fix the roast, 
or whatever, a stew or whatever like that. But -- 
then, we grew chickens, and we would butcher the 
chickens, so we would have like a roast and your 
potatoes -- we didn't grow carrots, carrots are 
kinda hard to grow for some reason, for us, so we 
didn't have that, but we would- she would would 
fix the roast with the potatoes and things. And 
um -- we could have okra, we grew okra, so we 
would have okra and it's -- the green beans, 
spiced squash or boiled squash, and just 
different things that you have today, but they 
were just- it took you longer to prepare because 
you usually had to go pick them from the garden, 
clean them, and take care of them and then get 
them ready to cook. So. And today, they're 
already prepared almost for you, so you don't 
have to do a lot of stuff for it.
Sanchez: Growing --
Harris: Like mom would make meatloaf whenever the beef was 
butchered, they'd have the ground beef to make 
your meatloaf. Just different things like that. 
The roasts, and the chicken, we could have fried 
chicken, we could make chicken and dumplings, you 
could have a roasted chicken. Almost like we have 
today you just had to prepare it in a different 
way.
Sanchez: At the time, what would you say was, like, your 
favorite food like growing up?
Harris: Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, and green 
beans.
Sanchez: That sounds so good.
Harris: I also like black-eyed-peas, fried okra, and sliced 
tomatoes. 
Sanchez: Mmm, yeah that sounds really good
Curry: Now I'm hungry. [laughs] Now, you said that the 
garden space was maybe about an acre?
Harris: Yes?
Curry: That sounds like not very much land to feed an 
entire family, so um -- I guess I'll ask, like 
how much were you -- sorry let me rephrase that, 
like what kinds of foods were you getting that 
you weren't preparing yourself? Was there, like, 
a market? Go ahead, go ahead.
Harris: Very very few honestly.
Curry: Mhm.
Harris: Because, well, honestly, there weren't -- if you go 
to the grocery store now, there are so many 
things available to you that were not available 
to us. Like we didn't grow lettuce. Now you can 
go to the grocery store to get a head of lettuce. 
Yes people grew what they called leaf lettuce, 
but- and it was just a leaf, but it was only 
available for a short time because it was called 
a cool season crop. But those things like that, 
most everything we grew. We'd have to go buy 
flour, cornmeal, sugar, syrup, you know some of 
the specialty type things but most everything 
else we grew. It was grown on the farm for us. We 
had pork, my daddy would butcher a hog in the 
fall, so we'd have the pork. And sometimes they 
would butcher a beef. Not every year did they 
butcher a beef because beef was harder to, well 
there was more of it. And then, you had to have a 
locker or a big deep freeze in order to hold all 
of that, because that was a lot of meat. With the 
pork, when he killed a hog, it was late in the 
fall, early winter, in the cold weather, he would 
take salt and the pieces of the hog he had cut 
up, he had on a big table in what was called a 
smokehouse, and he would salt those pieces of 
pork down and that's how they were preserved over 
the winter. The salt helped preserve that meat. 
So we could have ham, we could go out and cut off 
a piece of ham, he could go get a piece of bacon, 
make your own slices of bacon and we could grind 
some of the meat, and did grind quite a bit of 
the meat, and it was seasoned with your sage and 
salt and pepper, and all those kinds of spices 
that you wanted for making your sausage. So we 
had sausage patties. And my mom would make a lot 
of those up at one time, and then she'd also can 
them. She'd cook those after they were cooked, 
she'd put them in a jar and then she would pour 
the hot grease that was formed after making the 
sausage patties, she'd pour that on top of the 
jar and it was so hot that it would seal the jar. 
She would turn it upside down and the hot grease 
would come down to the top of the jar and then 
that sealed it, so that's how those were 
preserved. 
Curry: Wow
Harris: Yes, yes, mhm, so.
Curry: You mentioned a smokehouse, I'm not really sure what 
that is.
Harris: Well my daddy did not --
Curry: Uhuh --
Harris: But years ago, it was a small out building and 
people hung their meat on rafters or whatever 
that was in the smokehouse. And they would make a 
fire, or have a wood stove, or something out 
there, and they smoke the meat to preserve it. 
That was also a way of preserving the meat, but 
daddy just used the salt. Rubbing the salt into 
the fresh meat.
Sanchez: With the cattle that you raised, umm like, so you 
said the farmland itself was about an acre, but 
the cattle, um -- like did they stay, like, in 
pens, did they stay in like a barn? Like what 
kind of area?
Harris: They just were out in the pasture. No, we didn't 
keep them in a pen unless there was a reason for 
it. There were sometimes where they would need 
to, one might be sick or something and they'd 
have to isolate it. But no, all the other times, 
the cattle just ran free in the pastures. There 
was a creek. Some people had creeks for their 
cattle to drink from, some people had ponds for 
them to drink from, but they just ate the grass 
and drank from the pond or the creek. And just 
more or less roamed free. But you know, it was 
fenced, but yeah, they could still get out and 
move all over the property. 
Sanchez: Oh okay.
Curry: Were a lot of folks in your area keeping cattle like 
that?
Harris: Yes, most everybody did.
Sanchez: You said earlier that like y'all didn't sell that 
much when it came to, like, fruits or vegetables, 
but how much would you say, did y'all ever sell 
any meat? Or like as much as you would say with 
the vegetables?
Harris: Okay, I'm sorry, say that again?
Sanchez: Um, like you were saying how y'all would, like, 
rarely sell fruits or vegetables, is this the 
same for meat?
Harris: No, we did not sell the meat either because it was, 
pretty -- well the, the cattle, we might sell 
half of the cow to someone that was, we butchered 
-- have it butchered, because it had a lot of 
meat. But as far as the hog, once they were all 
butchered and they didn't put off that much meat 
for a family as large as ours was. So, yes we'd 
share some of the meat with our neighbors or 
friends or family, but no we didn't really sell 
it unless daddy sold half of the beef, planned 
that before it was ever butchered.
Sanchez: Mmm
Harris: We would be sharing the beef with some other family 
maybe.
Sanchez: Okay --
Harris: They would pay like, we would have to have cattle 
butchered, so they would help pay for having the 
cow butchered, and then they would do with it 
whatever their half was. And then my family would 
do it with what our family wanted to do with our 
half. 
Sanchez: Mm
Harris: So, most of that was putting it in like a 
commercial locker, that was in town, and there 
were big lockers where people rented these 
lockers especially to put the frozen beef, or 
chicken, or hogs, or whatever they wanted to put 
into that commercial locker. But you had to pay a 
fee to do that, and then because we didn't have a 
lot of refrigeration, a lot of ways to keep the 
meat or whatever, that was one of the only ways 
you could do that unless you could afford a huge 
deep freeze, that's what a freezer was called 
back then. It was called a deep freezer.
Curry: Alright, we are going through our questions, just a 
moment. 
Harris: Okay. I'll go back --
Curry: Go on -- 
Harris: On the preserving of the beans and stuff like that. 
On the beans, like -- Dante, you know what pinto 
beans are, don't you?
Curry: Yes.
Harris: Okay, those beans would be like what we would plant 
in the spring time, just like a bag of beans that 
you buy from the grocery store. We would plant 
those and they grew and then made the green 
beans, well if mom had too many green beans, she 
left those green beans on the vine to dry, they 
would continue to grow till they matured, and 
then they would dry, well once they were 
completely dried, we'd pick the dry beans and 
shell the pinto beans out of the hole, and that 
was our pinto beans, our dried beans, that we had 
during the winter time. And that's the same way 
we did the black-eyed-peas. You would harvest the 
fresh pea, and then if it was -- you had a lot 
more than you needed, you left them on the vine 
and let them dry and harvest them in the fall and 
then had your black-eyed-peas or any kind of bean 
or pea if it were a different kind of pea you 
could harvest and then dry out like that, so.
Curry: You, you mentioned the winter time, this is 
something I always think about is -- like winter 
time and growing all your food must be kind of 
difficult, um. Did, did y'all -- how did y'all 
prepare for that? Prepare for winter?
Harris: That's why we preserved everything because there 
was really nothing you could grow over the winter 
time unless you had a protected area like a hot 
house or something like that. People didn't 
really have those then unless they were able to 
make one, you know just put a shack together or 
whatever with plastic and stuff. But, and the 
plastic was not all available like we think about 
it nowadays, so. That's why all the beans, you'd 
dry the beans, you'd can the green beans, you 
would have your potatoes and whatever you'd have 
a special way of keeping the potatoes, like. 
You'd put those out on a bed of straw and then 
just kinda keep them as long as you could, 
because they wouldn't last all winter long 
either. So you kept them as long as you could and 
you had to be sure to put them where they could 
not freeze, because if they froze then they were 
no good. So, that's why we did all the preserving 
over the summer time and the fall, to keep stuff 
for over the winter.
Sanchez: How would y'all like, take care of like the cattle 
specifically over the winter? Like, would that be 
a time when you would, I dunno, I dunno how would 
you do it?
Harris: Um, they just had to tough it out. Even in a bad 
snowstorm or rain, and sad to say in hail, or 
whatever, plus there, if you had a huge barn, 
then you could get them in the barn but most 
people didn't have a barn big enough to handle 
that many heads of cattle, so. Sorry to say they 
just had to tough it out sometimes. And the 
winters were worse back then than they are now. 
And sometimes we would have snow and, course the 
cattle would have snow on their back from that 
and freezing rain and stuff, but just really 
nothing we could do for them.
Sanchez: Right. I mean it makes sense though, like that's 
how they were in nature, um, but would you just 
like --
Harris: [coughing]
Sanchez: Was. 
Harris: Sorry.
Sanchez: You're good. Was it a common occurrence I guess to 
like, lose like an animal during the winter?
Harris: Oh yes, yes, definitely that, and also, in calving 
times when the cow would be having her babies 
sometimes things would go wrong and the baby 
would die or maybe both of them would die. And 
that even happens nowadays. Y'know. There's, 
sometimes there's just nothing that can be done.
Sanchez: Right.
Curry: Now, this all sounds like a lot of hard work. Here's 
a question. Um, what sorts of things did y'all do 
for fun?
Harris: Well, we got to play out, course kids at that time, 
we didn't have all the toys
Curry: Mhm.
Harris: That are available now. We had bicycles. We could 
ride a bicycle. In the creek in the summertime we 
could go play in the creek, and we had games that 
we could play like marbles and jacks, little hand 
games that we could play, and of course read the 
books, and, but with my family, big as my family 
was, we couldn't afford to do a lot of things 
other than what we could think of there at home. 
we weren't able to take lots of trips, we did 
visit family and that was something that was done 
more frequently at that time than now. We would 
go like on Sunday afternoon and visit aunt and 
uncle, and my grandpa lived, oh probably ten or 
twelve miles from us and we would go see him 
sometimes and then... that side of my family, that 
was my mother's side of the family, I never knew 
my grandmother from that side. From my daddy's 
side of the family I never knew my grandpa from 
that side. So my grandmother lived with, 
alternated living with the kids, and then my 
grandpa, my mother's dad, had a daughter that was 
-- and a son -- that was still living at home so 
he was able to stay home, but my grandmother on 
my daddy's side didn't have anyone left, so she 
had just to live with the kids alternately. She 
didn't have anyone that could stay with her. She 
had to move with them. So we would go visit with 
them. And, cousins, we would, like, get together 
on the Fourth of July and stuff like that because 
we lived in the country and fireworks weren't 
allowed in town. Well people would come out to 
the country to shoot off fireworks and we'd have 
ice cream, make our own ice cream and have the 
fireworks and stuff like that. And that was some 
of the things that we did, and then, course, in 
the wintertime most of the time we were in school 
and not really able to travel that much all 
weekend if it were cold, so.
Curry: Hm.
Harris: Just types of things like that. And we didn't have 
TV till... probably 1964, 65, so. No, sorry about 
that, it was earlier than that, so, um, but it 
was just a little bitty TV. And sometimes we'd go 
over to the neighbor's house to watch TV because 
my sister, brother and I would because they had a 
little bigger TV than we did, and we'd go watch 
TV with them, so.
Curry: Now, you talked about your family a little bit. Um, 
something I'm curious about. So, were both of 
your parents, did both of your parents basically 
live on the land their whole lives, at least up 
until that point?
Harris: Yes, yes, mhm. My mother grew up on a farm. My 
daddy grew up on a farm. My daddy's daddy died 
when my daddy was like seven years old. So he had 
to more or less take over and help my grandmother 
with everything, so yes, they both lived on the... 
both sides of my parents lived on the farm.
Curry: Mhm.
Harris: When my daddy passed away, he still lived on the 
farm.
Curry: Mhm?
Harris: When my mother passed away, she had moved from the 
farm to town, so. Until 1995, they both grew, or, 
had lived on the farm.
Sanchez: Does your family still own that farm?
Harris: No. No.
Sanchez: Mhm.
Harris: No, my grandmother sold it in 1995.
Sanchez: Mm. Um...
Harris: Or my mother, my mother sold it in 1995.
Sanchez: Alright. Um...
Curry: Go ahead.
Sanchez: Well I was gonna say a question I had just have, 
um, do you like, do you still garden now that you 
don't live there anymore, or, um, I dunno, Hm.
Harris: Um, Grandpa and I have... a little bit of garden. 
Like, we have a bunch of onions growing right 
now. We have some tomato plants out, and um some 
pepper plants out but no we don't garden. What 
you really say "garden." We just do a few little 
things.
Sanchez: Hm.
Harris: There is a man that lives out about 5 or 6 miles 
from us that has a garden and we go out and buy 
fresh okra and tomatoes and stuff like that from 
him. So we don't grow enough here in town, we 
don't have enough space to grow that much garden. 
Sanchez: Right. Hm. Almost there.
Curry: Alright. So, here is a question, and you can 
approach this however you want. Now that we've 
talked a little bit about what it was like for 
you growing up, um, is there anything that you 
wish people my age knew about agriculture? About 
raising food, about raising cattle, growing food, 
anything like that.
Harris: It would be nice for people your age to know about 
it. It's like kids nowadays have no idea that... 
where eggs come from usually. They don't know 
where you get the hamburger meat that you have a 
hamburger from. And they don't really know that 
some things grow on the vine that you can go out 
and just pick it off and wash it and eat it. 
There's just a lot of things that the kids do not 
have any idea that you plant a seed and watch it 
grow and it makes a fruit or a vegetable that you 
can eat.
Curry: Mhm.
Sanchez: Um, hm.
Curry: Yeah, you know, when I was in high school, um, I 
knew someone who kept some chickens. Um, and they 
would send me pictures sometimes of them out with 
the chickens, like picking up batches of eggs, 
and I would always just think, like, wow. It's 
kind of, it's cool but it's kind of, like, 
surprising to see people my age doing stuff like 
that.
Harris: Right, right, and you know, right now there are... 
growing chickens then... and having them and, there 
are several of 'em here in town.
Curry: Mhm?
Harris: That have little chicken houses and whatever. So, 
yeah it's, it's, it's fun to watch em. To grow, 
you know, um in fact going back to my early life.
Curry: Yeah.
Harris: My mom and dad would buy like fifty little baby 
chickens in the springtime which would be about 
now, when the warmer weather was warmer, and they 
would let them grow. And then we would butcher 
some of them. Like you would go butcher a chicken 
and you would have, clean it and whatever and 
have a fried chicken lunch. 
Curry: Mhm?
Harris: And then some of them would grow, those would be 
like roosters. The rooster. The ones whose -- the 
hens we would keep. And then that's where we got 
the eggs, to do you know for the hens to be hen 
layers, lay the eggs and whatever and then the 
roosters we would usually butcher, or they would 
just roam around. So. But, no, mom and dad would 
go buy some at the early springtime and then we'd 
just watch em grow and then, as I said we'd eat 
some of the chickens and then the others we kept 
for... the eggs.
Curry: Mhm. Now when you say you had to go buy some in the 
early springtime, did they, did they just tend 
not to make it through the winter?
Harris: Right. Yeah, well, and most of the time we didn't 
have the facilities to keep them, over winter. 
But um baby chicken over winter. So no most of 
the people who, um, hatched the eggs into the 
little chickens would have y'know the facility 
where they could do that. They would probably 
start like in the wintertime. But then the, the 
reason why we did it over the springtime was the 
grass and whatever would become available for 
them to eat.
Curry: Mhm.
Harris: So they would just eat bugs and grass and table 
scraps that you would put out for them to eat. 
But, by that, by wintertime those chickens that 
you bought in the springtime would be full-grown 
chickens.
Curry: Hm.
Sanchez: Hm. So like, as um, you know, I guess we as a 
culture I guess, move more away from farming in 
like the traditional sense, right, um you know 
for better or for worse, right, probably for 
worse if I'm being honest here. Do you worry 
about, like, food security and, like, safety in 
your area? Or just the country as a whole? 
Harris: I don't worry that much about it, Dante, because I 
think, we -- there are ways to provide for it. It 
is becoming more um -- sometimes you feel not as 
safe eating some of the things because you don't 
know where they came from or how they were 
produced, or where they were produced. So yes in 
that way it is kinda scary when you go buy your 
food because you know, you got reports of 
salmonella poisoning and all of that, so. But 
that can happen anywhere, but it seems that there 
is more so that type of thing happening nowadays 
than you ever heard of growing up on the farm. Um 
-- some of the insecticides, and whatever that 
they use nowadays, to keep the fruits and 
vegetables healthy, clean, or whatever are not 
good for our bodies. But, you know, I still think 
providing for the family is not a scarcity or 
anything like that, so. I do think that some of 
the commercial farms or whatever could probably 
have a few more security in the insecticides and 
whatever it is that they use.
Curry: Hm.
Sanchez: Hm.
Curry: No -- I think that that's a really nice perspective. 
I think -- I think sometimes it is very easy to 
be maybe doom and gloom --
Sanchez: Right --
Curry: -- about the future of food, especially with what we 
just talked about; a lot of young people maybe 
feeling a bit disconnected from where they get 
food, how they get food, how it is even grown at 
all.
Harris: Right, Right.
Curry: But, y'know. Of course there are still folks out 
there doing that.
Harris: Right. You know, there are a lot of kids, probably 
ninety percent of the kids, don't know that a 
potato comes from the ground. You know, it's down 
in the dirt. A sweet potato is in the dirt. 
They've only seen them like in the grocery store, 
they don't know where they come from. You know? 
So? Those are little things that I wish that the 
younger kids growing up knew more about. Where 
their food comes from, how it is produced, but um 
-- a lot of that depends on parents wanting to 
teach their kids about it too. 
Sanchez: Um -- so the -- the city that we are currently in, 
and a lot of like more cities like Denton and um- 
like I don't know, more urban like areas um that 
are spread across the country, I feel like there 
are more- I'm sorry I'm stumbling over my words 
here. But I feel like, um- we are entering more 
into more like, a food desert area, which is 
essentially just an area where like all the food 
that comes in is like bought or shipped in, and 
nothing is being really grown anymore. So how 
would you say like, we, let's say as college 
students or whatnot right, how could we like um- 
I don't know like what's something we should keep 
in mind to like stay kinda food secure I guess. I 
don't know if that made sense but I'm sorry 
[laughs]. 
Harris: Well a lot of kids, college kids, high school, 
middle school, and all of that, they can learn 
what we call community gardens. I know some of 
the towns are beginning to have those where an 
area is given to a group of people to guide 
others and how to plant the food and harvest it 
and keep it going. So I think, if a lot of more 
communities got involved in it then it kinda 
keeps going from this community to see how well 
this one is done, so someone else would want to 
try it. So I think if we got more people involved 
in types of things like community gardens then it 
might help a lot as far as not having a food 
desert, so.
Sanchez: Right.
Curry: Yeah --
Harris: You'd have a lot of fresh vegetables, you'd have a 
lot of things that would probably have to be 
thrown away too because people won't harvest them 
whenever they need to but you would have 
availability there.
Curry: Mm yeah. And I, I think that this in particular 
would be a good community to do that in. I didn't 
know this for a while, but here in Denton we have 
the biggest community garden in the United 
States.
Sanchez: and -- 
Harris: Really?
Curry: Yeah! Shiloh Field, we learned about this in our 
class --
Sanchez: Oh, Shiloh's the biggest?
Curry: Yeah. 
Sanchez: That's wild.
Curry: I think we are gonna go there next week. 
Sanchez: We're going Thursday. 
Curry: Awesome. But yeah, I appreciate that note on 
community gardens because that's something that I 
think especially something here in Denton we can 
pay attention to. 
Sanchez: That's also like, a focus of the class and 
whatnot, because that we've been talking about 
like -- and this class specifically our 
professors or what not are trying to set up a way 
where we can have more community gardens around 
campus. So I think that ties in really well, 
yeah.
Harris: And a lot of the schools that are more agriculture 
inclined would probably have a little community 
garden. But when you have just a regular college, 
they may not you know think about a community 
garden. But to me that's a good idea. There's a 
small one down, not too far from us, I don't know 
who all is allowed to be there you know, to get 
the produce, I don't that much about it, but it 
has just within the last four to five years came 
about, you know. So some of the areas do have it, 
some churches will have it, and some of the 
schools are beginning to teach the children about 
little community gardens.
Curry: Hm.
Sanchez: Hm.
Curry: Alright, well we appreciate your time, um -- do you 
have any like last thoughts on anything that 
we've discussed? Anything that you feel like is 
left unsaid?
Harris: I'm gonna look over my notes and see.
Curry: Yeah of course. 
Harris: Pretty much I think we talked about everything that 
I have, let's see. I think I did make a statement 
about how ninety-five percent of the food that we 
ate when I was growing up, came from the farm, so 
we didn't have to go out and buy, except those 
that we could not produce, you know like the 
flour, the cornmeal, cereal, and stuff like that, 
the sugar that I talked about earlier. So pretty 
much ninety-five percent of it came from the farm 
and pretty much we ate the same as we do today, 
we have different types of vegetables available 
that we didn't have at that time, so, I think 
that's about -- so many, I don't know, there are 
so many varieties of food available today from 
when I was growing up. And people today go to the 
grocery store and buy food that is sometimes 
already, or completely repaired, or prepared. And 
on the farm we had to plant the food, we had to 
let it grow, we had to pick it or dig it, and 
clean it and then prepare it before we could eat. 
And Dante, and Isaiah, I know that you know going 
into the grocery store you'll see packages of 
mashed potatoes already done, you'll see a lot of 
things that are already done. And those things 
were not available to us at all, and even they've 
only come about in the last ten years or maybe 
less than that. So, I think a lot of people 
complain about the food insecurities and all of 
that, but this prepared food makes the prices so 
much higher. If people would go buy a bag of 
potatoes, peel them, mash them, in their homes, 
they'd have ten meals compared to what one little 
bag of mashed potatoes, already made and frozen 
for you costs.
Sanchez: Hm.
Curry: Hm.
Harris: A lot of people make their own food preparation 
harder than it should be. Or buying the food more 
expensive than it should be. 
Sanchez: Right.
Curry: Alright.
Harris: That's about all that I have, my comment, so.
Curry: Alright, excellent! Well thank you very much for 
agreeing to this interview.
Harris: You're very welcome, Dante, happy to do it.
Curry: Yeah of course! And we will go ahead and end it 
there.
Sanchez: Yeah!
Harris: Okay.
Sanchez: Thank you so much! 
Harris: Thank you! You guys do good!
