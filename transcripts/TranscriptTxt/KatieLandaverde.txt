Brayan Rebolledo: Hi. My name is Brayan Rebolledo, and this 
my interview with Katie --
Katie Landaverde: Katie Landaverde. 
Brayan Rebolledo Awesome. All right, can you tell me a bit 
about yourself, of like, your interest in 
gardening, or like, if it's a hobby.
Katie Landaverde: Sure, um, so by profession I am -- I work 
in public education, um, and I grew up, um, I 
grew up on a farm, and, you know, my dad, my 
grandfather, always had gardening, so I grew up 
around a lot of gardening. Um, I don't think I 
was particularly interested in it as a kid. Um, I 
kind of dabbled, you know, like I'd grow one or 
two things and kind of in college, and, you know, 
when I was younger, I grew things here or there. 
I'd buy, like, a tomato plant or two, just like, 
for fun in the spring kind of thing. But I was 
not, not really much into gardening until, 
really, about four or five years ago, I kind of, 
I don't really know what sparked it exactly, but 
I just kind of developed this, this really 
intense passion for it. And it's, it is just 
really, truly a hobby for me, but it's, you know, 
it's a way that we spend time as a family. We 
grow food. You know, it's taken a kind of a large 
space in my life now, and I really love it.
Rebolledo: Yeah. Have you been involved in any like, 
community gardening projects, like, since you 
work in public education, do you think you had 
any plans like get kids involved in in these type 
of projects?
Landaverde: Yeah, so I wrote -- I've written a couple of 
grants for schools to get gardens. So, the first 
one was back in 2018 and then I wrote a follow up 
grant to that one in 2020 and really just to 
expand it, add some raised beds and fix, kind of, 
some of the drainage issues and watering concerns 
we had with our original garden, we relocated 
some things and expanded and added, like an 
outdoor classroom and outdoor space. But that was 
really the vision was to, you know, make sure 
kids had opportunities to garden and have that 
exposure.
Rebolledo: Have you just with that, yeah. Have you helped 
our, like, school gardens? Have you gone there 
yourself, just to see how the kids were doing 
with it, how the garden has gone? Gone along. 
Landaverde: Yeah! So, I did have, you know, some experience 
the school where, you know, I was, I was teaching 
at the time, um, you know, with, with our school 
garden. But I have visited a couple of other 
campuses just to kind of see how, how community 
gardens or student gardens work on other 
campuses. And I've seen a few different models, 
um, but, yeah, it's, it's, um, I think it's a 
really, it's a really great opportunity for kids. 
No --
Rebolledo: Yeah, because I work at Lake Dallas Elementary, 
and I saw how there was new plants. Now when I 
went to take them outside, I'm like, wow, these 
look very beautiful.
Landaverde: Yeah, yeah. We just planted those last 
Saturday.
Rebolledo: Yeah. She was like, hey, do you need to use the 
gym right now. I'm like, no, I y'all could go in 
and she said, I'm just putting all my gardening 
things in there so we can start getting it done. 
But what you call it? What can we do to help grow 
the knowledge of gardening to the younger kids 
that might take an interest to it later on as a 
career as well, like as farmers or agriculturists 
around that.
Landaverde: I think helping make it a little bit relevant 
to their lives, at least for me as a kid. I mean, 
it was cool, it was interesting, but I wasn't. I 
wasn't particularly passionate or excited about 
gardening as a kid. And I think it's, it's true, 
because it didn't necessarily seem relatable to 
my life and my experiences. So, I think finding 
ways to make it applicable to kids and helping 
them understand why this might be important to 
learn. You know, I've certainly had a lot of 
conversations with my own kids now about, you 
know, sustainability, and, you know, it's really 
cool that we have, you know, some ways to produce 
our own food and, you know, think conversations 
like that, and then having them help out with, 
like cooking and things, I think, really helps 
make it like, a little more tangible, a little 
bit more relatable to them.
Rebolledo: Yeah, I understand that. Because what you call 
it, I tried growing a, well, this is me as a kid 
back then. I tried going to orange tree. I 
grabbed the seeds from an orange, I don't know 
why. I just thought this. I'm like, Oh, I'm a 
plant. I'm watering it. And then, just never grew 
up. I'm like, Oh, okay. I tried.
Landaverde: Yeah, yeah. I mean, my kids have certainly 
planted lots of seeds like that. They'll, they'll 
keep seeds from an apple and go plant them 
somewhere in the earth. They don't. Really do 
anything, that's fine. Um, so it's the idea.
Rebolledo: No, yeah, but more like growing more into, like 
the community, how you think we can help other 
people get more knowledge and of gardening, like, 
what? What can what can be done to get everyone 
more involved in like a community garden? Let's 
say --
Landaverde: Well, I think a lot of it is education. A lot 
of people are just like, oh, I don't have a green 
thumb. And they think it's, you either have a 
green thumb or you don't. And it's really, it's 
just, did you take time to learn some knowledge 
about how to grow plants or not? It's just, it's 
just having a knowledge base. So, we certainly 
need to, I think, do more to educate people. And 
I'll say this from personal experience. You know, 
I am a member of a couple of different like 
gardening communities and organizations, but I 
find it really hard to actually go to any 
meetings or trainings or things that are offered, 
because a lot of times they're offered just at 
difficult times for people who are working, you 
know, it's a lot of a lot of times they'll offer 
classes, you know, 2pm on a Wednesday. Well, 
obviously, I'm at work, so, you know, things like 
that. So, you know, there are a lot of resources, 
and there's a lot of education out there, but it 
isn't always easily accessible to people. Also, a 
lot of times you do have to pay for things like 
that, and you know, that can be a huge deterrent 
if you're, you know, just casually interested in 
learning a little bit about planting a garden, 
paying $200 to take a class seems bit absurd. 
Yeah, that seems, seems like a lot, especially if 
you're not fully committed, you're just kind of 
interested in exploring this as an idea. So, I 
think making education a little more accessible 
to people. I mean, obviously there's the 
internet, there's YouTube, there's, you know, 
there's a million things out there, so people can 
certainly, you know, do their own digging. But I 
think it helps make it a little more tangible and 
a little it encourages people to see things in 
real life and have kind of real conversations and 
interactions with people.
Rebolledo: Oh, yeah, because me, I know, because this, 
because I grew up in Wiley. I know over there, 
there's not much of a community garden, but 
there's schools that do it like they do a small 
garden to the side with an outdoor classroom, but 
over there, there's not much of a community 
garden or anything. And when you just join 
groups, I don't think there's any groups over 
there, because everyone just stays from Plano 
over here. You think that that should be like, 
more broad, like everywhere else, where people 
can get more like, know more about growing foods 
like fruits and vegetables for themselves and 
casually, just save money for themselves as well 
in the long run.
Landaverde: Yeah, absolutely. Um, I mean, I would, I would 
love to see community gardens really take off and 
do better. I think it's for all I'm speaking for 
myself here, but I don't, I don't think this is a 
unique experience. You know, I've thought about 
that and really, you know, it would be really 
great to start a community garden somewhere, and 
to head something like that up. But it also feels 
very daunting. How do you how do you start a 
group? How do you start an organization? How do 
you find the space to do it and then get people 
to join? Do you need permits? You know that those 
when you really start thinking through the 
logistics, it all of a sudden seems crazy, kind 
of, kind of scary. Like, okay, I can't just show 
up and start planning stuff in this plot. And, 
you know, guerilla gardening there. So, um, yeah, 
I think, I think it absolutely I would love to 
see community gardens expand, but also just 
training and resources for people, and how do you 
start a community garden would be, I think, 
something that would be beneficial to help a lot 
of people get those kinds of projects up and off 
the ground?
Rebolledo: Yeah, I feel like it should be. That's, that's 
like, that's a problem that or, like, something 
you get, we need to go, like, go ask the city, 
Hey, would this be viable? Like, y'all could, 
like, help start up a Community Guard, like, get 
it out there, have more people. Because with them 
getting it out there, more people will get 
involved and want to get involved, and actually 
put in time to it, to just, like, get everyone 
involved. Because not many cities really do much, 
they just go on with their lives and just do 
nothing, just like we could help the environment, 
just by growing a community gardening or 
something like to benefit the environment. 
Absolutely, yeah, and, but what? What got you, 
like, into, like, gardening. Like, how did you 
said, like you the last four or five years? Like, 
you just got a spark an interest into it --
Landaverde: Again, I'll be honest. So, my interest in 
gardening did not start with growing food. It 
really started with, really, my true kind of 
passion that this kind of grew out of was, I 
really started learning about native plants, like 
Texas native plants and prairie restoration, and 
how to, you know, grow native Texas plants as a 
part of, you know, restoring our ecosystems that 
we're, you know, we're losing. So really, that's, 
that's how it started. To start with a couple 
flower beds of native plants. Native plants, and 
really kind of exploded from there. I fell in 
love with it, and kind of just kept expanding and 
expanding. And then, really, after probably a 
year or so of that, I really was like, Okay, now 
I want to grow food. So really, it didn't start 
with food, but I now grow both. I have a lot of 
native plants and flower beds and things like 
that that I genuinely enjoy growing and gardening 
caring for. But I also have a pretty large actual 
garden, you know, with things we can eat.
Rebolledo: So, like, you have any advice or, like, how to, 
like, start at least a small, like, garden of 
food, like, like, growing of vegetables, like 
farm or small --
Landaverde: I think the thing a lot of people get hung up 
on, because if you start looking at gardening, it 
can, it can just feel overwhelming, like you have 
to learn all the things, right? Because if you 
really get into it, and you start watching 
YouTube videos and reading articles and stuff, it 
can feel overwhelming fast, especially when you 
start getting into, you know how to amend soil, 
and you know pH balances and soil like it can get 
scientific fast. And you're like, I don't know 
what any of this means. I just wanted to grow a 
tomato. I don't know. Never mind. And it can 
feel, it can feel daunting, and especially once 
you start pricing things, because especially a 
lot of times, I think people think you have to 
have really expensive tools, or, you know, fancy 
raised garden beds, or the best soil, the 
absolute best soil. And I mean, those, those 
things can help. And you know, you, you too, need 
some decent soil. Ish, but you know, there's ways 
to do those things on a budget, and there's ways 
that, you know there's, there's really nothing 
wrong unless you know you truly have, you know, 
just full clay soil or something like that. 
There's, there's a lot of things you can plant 
just right in the ground, um, and you don't, you 
don't need fancy equipment, or, you know, garden 
beds or anything like that. You know you don't. 
You don't have to go buy a tiller. You can, you 
know, if you have a patch of yard in your in your 
backyard, you can, you know, it's it. You don't. 
You don't have to buy, like, a whole tiller, and, 
you know, build, build raised beds or things like 
that. You know you can do things like just 
collecting cardboard, laying cardboard out on 
your grass, layering a few layers of cardboard, 
and then mulch on top. If you do that, it'll kill 
off your grass and make really, really rich. It 
feeds the soil and makes really rich soil you can 
plant right into. And it'll kill, kill off that 
whole area and make great garden soil. So, 
there's, there's easy, cheap ways to do things 
like that. You know, grow bags are really 
inexpensive. You can buy 12 to 5 of them for, you 
know, 10 or 20 dollars and those are just little 
felt bags that you can plant things in. And you 
can grow, really, almost anything in a grow bag. 
So there, there's really inexpensive ways to, you 
know, grow things.
Rebolledo: And you said this, like long time, like, right 
when we started out, you said that your father 
and your grandfather were into the -- what did 
they grow? Were they just growing plants, or were 
they growing food? Like, did they have a big 
patch of field?
Landaverde: Yeah, so, um, in both those, both of those 
scenarios, so my dad and my papa, they both had 
had gardens when I was little, and they both grew 
food, um, a lot. You know, that was really, 
really what it was there for, what it was, um, 
but, yeah, my especially my papa, he, I mean, he 
grew, it grew enough food to really, I mean, that 
was where a lot of, a lot of meals came from. Was 
straight from the garden. You know, we'd go pick 
green beans, and that's what we were having for 
dinner, you know, I mean, really, that's, that's 
where a lot of our food came from.
Rebolledo: And do you think, like, people should have more 
of like a garden for themselves to, like, help 
ease up on, like, spending money, even though, 
like, it's gonna take time for it to grow. Do you 
think for them to just have a garden, them in the 
backyard, or just right there with their like 
light, like there, because I see, I seen people 
in my apartment complex, yeah, the grow lights, 
they have it on them. Do you think they should 
just have what? Have one with themselves, like, 
for personal use and save money?
Landaverde: Yeah. I mean, I would certainly encourage 
people to do that, and I don't. Think, you know, 
we're necessarily bound to choosing, you know, 
one over the other. Have own it, having a 
personal garden versus a community garden, you 
know? I don't, I think there's, there's valid 
reasons to have both, and to participate in both. 
You know, I think for me, at least, I mean and my 
family, I really enjoy growing things. You know, 
in some ways, sure, it gives me, like a little 
bit of peace of mind, of like we're able to 
produce. I mean, no, obviously we can't live off 
of our little backyard garden, but you know, we 
do produce, you know, food that we can eat and 
enjoy and that's like kind of a nice little peace 
of mind. But, you know, it's also, you know, we 
can cook with those things. And that's really fun 
to be able to not just grow food but then prepare 
it and enjoy it. And, you know, serve, serve 
people things that you know, we grew.
Rebolledo: And just going off with the next question, do 
you have any advice for anyone in the north Texas 
region about gardening, how to start it up, or 
how to, like, get into it, just how to get any 
type of knowledge, just even by reading articles 
like, what do you think would be the best thing 
to start a garden in Texas?
Landaverde: Well, obviously our climate here, is a lot 
different from gardening and other places. So, we 
actually have, we have the ability to grow a lot 
of things really well here, but we have to be 
very mindful of our climate, and that actually 
gives us somewhat limited Windows comparatively 
compared to other places where we can plant 
things and grow things. So really, just kind of 
being mindful of that. So, for example, you know, 
really here we're not completely out of the 
frost. You know, danger of frost until late 
March, maybe or even early April, sometimes some, 
sometimes mid-March. But, I mean, it's a little 
unpredictable, so it can be difficult to plant 
things outside that, you know, or frost tender 
before that date. But also, we don't have a long 
time before the heat really sets in. By mid-May 
gets hot and the temperatures keep rising. So, if 
you want things to have time to get established 
and really established roots, you have a pretty 
narrow window to do that. So, I think sometimes, 
maybe people get frustrated when they try to 
start things from seeds, especially outside in 
like April or May. Because if you go to the store 
and you just pick up a packet of tomato seeds, it 
may say, plant outdoors, you know, in April. 
Well, well, that's not necessarily the best 
advice for where we live. It's not impossible. 
But, you know, trying to start, start seeds 
indoors, you know, as often as you can before the 
fear of frost or, you know, don't there's, 
there's really no shame in going to a garden 
center and picking up some, some seedlings that 
were, you know, were started a couple months ago, 
just because we have such a narrow window there. 
So, I think that's something to be mindful of. We 
do have, for the most part in our region. I'm 
talking widely in DFW. We have a couple of 
different eco regions here, but you know, a lot 
of people around here have, you know we're in 
black line prairie, so we generally have pretty 
good soil, but it can be very heavy. And a lot of 
people, you know, I have a lot of clay at my 
house, and I think I know it's very common. So 
just being mindful of, you know, what, what type 
of soil you have, it doesn't have to be quite so 
nitty gritty, although you can take a soil sample 
to your local office, and they will sample your 
soil and, you know, give you some readings on it. 
But really, just to get started, if you go 
outside, you know, just kind of dig around in 
your soil a little bit, you know, and see how, 
what, what type of soil you have, because if, 
even if it is really heavy clay, it's not, it's 
not impossible or difficult to amend that soil. 
So just being mindful of what kind of soil you 
have in your light conditions, making sure you 
find a nice, sunny, sunny spot. 
Rebolledo: No, yeah, because honestly, this Texas weather 
is unpredictable. One day it's very sunny, then 
next day it's cold in the morning and cold the 
rest of the day, just like last month in April, 
just that one Saturday, it was just freezing 
cold. Yeah, and then, and then, especially the 
rain, because there's times it's, it's a light 
rain, it's just normal. But then there's other 
times where heavy thunderstorms are going on. And 
especially now that we're like, we're like, we're 
still in the middle, like tornado season and 
everything. You think those heavy winds, 
especially if a tornado comes by, would affect 
the crops, like anything --
Landaverde: Absolutely, I mean, you know, I haven't, I 
haven't had an actual tornado come to come. 
Through my house, you know, with a garden, but, 
um, you know, we often have, you know, pretty 
good winds or hail occasionally. So, you know, 
that can certainly, that can certainly damage, 
damage your plants. You know, I had some plants 
with hail damage a couple weeks ago, but they'll 
generally recover from that kind of thing. I'll 
lose plants here or there too to weather. But if 
you're mindful about planting times, and 
especially in the summer of heat, being mindful 
of that and being mindful of what plants grow 
best in what season. So especially, you know, I 
think people get frustrated because they're like, 
well, I planted, you know, they'll kind of tell 
me what they planted in the spring. I'm like, oh, 
those would have grown a lot better in the fall, 
that kind of thing. So just being mindful of when 
different plants do best here in particular --
Rebolledo: Oh, yeah, because then people are like, oh, I 
want to eat my food. I want to get all this 
ready, just for this certain time of year. Like, 
let's just say, some girls' pumpkin or something, 
they try growing it in the spring, or like, the 
summer, just trying to get it up and running 
before everyone has their hands on a pumpkin. And 
like, oh, I got the biggest one. No, I got the 
smallest one or something. But, and --
Landaverde: Pumpkins do actually take, take quite a bit of 
time to be ready, like usually, 90 to 120, days. 
So, if you want to Halloween, pumpkin plant it, 
plant it in June --
Rebolledo: Yes. But even though the weather gets like in 
June, like here in Texas, it gets very hot, and I 
heard that this summer is going to be drier than 
last summer, so just being mindful of how to 
treat everything around and getting around how 
dry and it's going to get in the summer. But, 
yeah, but what foods do you think we can cook 
using garden grown veggies? 
Landaverde: Um, well, you can cook, I mean, almost 
anything. So, for me, I grow, I'm gonna tell you 
what I grow. So, I grow squash, beans, cucumbers, 
kale, onions, radishes, carrots, tomatoes, 
cantaloupe, watermelon, bell peppers, jalapenos, 
tomatillos, strawberries, garlic, tons of herbs. 
So, you know, basil, rosemary, tribes, oregano, 
mint. So, lots of things. So, you have tons, tons 
and tons of combinations. I can tell you some of 
my favorite things that we make. So, my husband 
grew up in Mexico City, and he is absolutely the 
cook in our house. So fresh salsa is amazing. So 
that's, that's great. I can go out the garden and 
grab some serranos or jalapenos, and, you know, 
tomatoes, onions, and you know, he'll, he'll 
roast them and make a fresh salsa. So easy little 
things like that are great. Um, I specifically 
grow tomatillos, just so I can walk in and hand 
my husband, like a whole handful of tomatillos 
and tell him to make me enchiladas. And that's 
the best. So, yeah, I mean, you can, you can do 
so much with, with growing, you know. I mean, I 
listed a bunch of things. So even just growing, 
you know, 234, different things you can do. 
There's a lot that's really versatile. 
Rebolledo: Oh, yeah, that's all good. No worries. But, um, 
just moving on to the next thing, the kids 
gardening. How do you think we should like 
incorporate more of getting their hands dirty, 
getting them to know more about the environment 
just by gardening or something around the route.
Landaverde: I think kids really want to know the why behind 
something often, so sometimes, when we present 
information, but we don't tell them why it would 
be important for them to learn, or why they 
should care, it's hard to, you know, for it to 
seem relatable. Um, so, you know, and with my own 
kids, you know, we're we, we have a lot of 
conversations about, you know, sustainability 
and, um, things like that. And I think, I think 
for them, they always have lots of questions. And 
I think that really helps it make it a little 
more relevant to their lives, and especially, you 
know, if you can get them involved in in 
harvesting and planting seeds and kind of walking 
through the process like my kid, my kids are, and 
they didn't, I'll say this, they didn't used to 
be super interested in gardening with me. It's 
really just been in the last year or two. And I 
think it's because they've seen me do it now for 
so long that it took a little chance. Yeah, but 
it took time, you know, there were, there were a 
couple years there, I'd be like, you guys want to 
come help me? Like, I'm gonna plant seeds. And be 
like, no, you know. But now, you know, my kids 
all the time, like, I'll come home from work, and 
I'll be like, are we gonna go work in the garden? 
When are we going outside? Like they're very 
interested. Or, if I'm out there working, they'll 
come out and be like, what are you. Doing, like, 
how can I help? And so, you know, just getting 
them involved in little things, just even pulling 
weeds, you know, or explaining what you're doing 
and why and how, how things work, and really kind 
of explaining the process and pointing out, you 
know, any, any interesting things you can, I 
think, makes it a little more relevant to them.
Rebolledo: No, yeah, because most of the kids I work at was 
there in alphabets. And like Dallas, they always 
ask, why, why? Why? And we, we explain it in our 
own terms, where we already understand what 
[unintelligible] said, but them saying, Oh, but 
why? And I feel like that, like we should more 
introduce more like a simple idea to them, of 
like, why it's important to garden, especially 
now that many people are bringing up climate 
change and everything and how that could, like, 
just even starting a small garden could benefit 
us in the long run. Do you think, do you have it, 
like, any ideas on how we could start, like, 
workshops before those kids, like an after-school 
program where they could go and just garden?
Landaverde: Yeah? I mean, honestly, there's actually a lot 
of really great existing resources. I think the 
biggest issues a lot of schools run into is just 
finding staffing to do it. You know, we all know 
the stress is on public education right now and 
on our teachers, so it's it can be very difficult 
to staff programs like that, but if schools can 
find, you know, a person to run it, I think I'll 
add this too. I think a lot of times, teachers 
are maybe hesitant to take that on. If they don't 
have any personal experience with it, they think 
they have to be a master gardener in order to 
lead some type of garden club on a campus. But 
you can really start without having any 
experience and really just learn along with the 
kids. So here, here in Texas, the Aim and the 
AgriLife program and 4h they have lots of 
programs, and they're really great about 
supporting schools and getting gardens up and 
running. They'll help sponsor clubs. So, there's 
a couple of different, you know, you can do just 
a garden club, or, you know, they have some 
options where they'll help support you in kind of 
a garden cooking club combination where we're 
teaching kids to grow the food and then also how 
to prepare it. No --
Rebolledo: Yeah, because over there in Lake Dallas, I know 
they have a cooking club, and I've seen kids who 
-- they get off, and they were so excited about 
what they made. I feel like, if they knew where 
that food came from, and then using that same 
food that they grew themselves in their own 
cooking, like creation that they made. Yeah, then 
they'll come to appreciate how gardening and all 
the process and not the long patience to wait for 
just a single plant to grow up. Yeah, yeah, 
exactly.
