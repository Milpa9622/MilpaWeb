Dakota Sams: Alright, man, it's good to be here with you 
today. We got Jay Randall on the little podcast 
today. First off, can you tell me a little bit 
about yourself? Yeah.
Jay Randall: Well, first of all, thank you for having me 
today, Dakota. I really appreciate it. I was 
really honored that you asked me. So, I was 
definitely excited about being on here with you. 
A little bit about me. Where do I start? I've 
probably lived about 10 or 12 different lives 
just in the last 10 years. While I'm originally 
from California, on Sacramento, I spent the 
majority of my childhood in South, excuse me, 
Southern California. LA, South Central and then 
out of the Inland Empire, specifically Claremont, 
California.  
I'm a father. I'm a son of a Hall of Fame chef. 
My father, chef, Joe Randall has had a lot of 
high-profile positions, literally all over the 
country. When I was young, we were in when I was 
in South Central LA, he was an executive chef, I 
think, Director of Food Services at Southern Cal 
and if I'm not mistaken, his sous chef, Hugo, 
eventually became a head executive chef. I think 
he was the personal chef to the USC football team 
during the Pete Carroll era. So that's one of my 
father's former proteges. He also was an 
executive chef at LAX. And during the mid-80s, he 
was executive then we moved to Maryland for a few 
years. He was executive chef at a place called 
Baltimore fish market was very prestigious, high-
profile establishment. Unfortunately, it went 
bankrupt after two years, and so that brought us 
back to California empire. And he was a chef, 
Chef Instructor at Cal Poly Pomona and their 
School of Hotel and Restaurant Management. And 
that was a very prestigious position at the time 
he was he successfully brought some very 
renowned, prominent celebrity chefs at the time, 
Julia Child, Martin Yan from Yan can cook, and a 
few other people that are pretty renowned then 
he, after that position, he opened a restaurant 
called George's, which was in West Hollywood, 
specifically off of Melrose. And some of the 
owners of this particular restaurant was Brad 
Johnson, who, at the time, was the owner of the 
Roxbury. And if you remember that, that night at 
the Roxbury from Saturday, "What is love, Baby 
don't --" Yeah. That's that guy. He owned, that 
restaurant slash club, Denzel Washington, Madonna 
norm, Nixon, Debbie Allen, and a few other people 
I just can't remember, but he was offered the 
executive position and turned him down for the 
door. He was a consultant. He helped him open it. 
They offered him to make to keep the position 
full time, but he did. He had a second thought 
inside. He didn't want to make that commitment.  
So, we ended up moving to Maryland, where I went 
to eighth grade through high school, studied 
football, and eventually ended up in southeast 
where I played college football, University of 
South Carolina in Georgia Southern. Following my 
athletic student athlete career in Georgia 
Southern, I lived in Atlanta for 10 and a half 
years. I actually got into coaching. I had a 
brief stint with arena football, very brief, but 
that got me into coaching high school athletics. 
Two years of private school year at a public 
school, ended up as a GA at Texas Tech 
University. That didn't work out. So that brought 
me back to Atlanta, age 30, trying to figure out 
what is it that I want to do.  
I have one more stint as a football coach at a 
prep school. And then after that, I got into 
group fitness at this gym called X3 sports in 
Marietta, Georgia, and that got me into the fight 
game. I became an amateur boxer slash personal 
trainer. A year later, I started dabbling in the 
entertainment industry. Became an actor, fitness 
model and so on and so forth. The opportunities 
just kept coming, and then I actually got, this  
is ironic, my very first position in the world, 
my very first job I ever had was a busboy at a 
restaurant called Ralphie diner in Timonium, 
Maryland, when I was the summer before my junior 
year of high school. Actually, no, it was the end 
of my 10th grade year. So yeah, but yeah, into 
the summer before my junior high school. My dad 
was the executive chef. Unfortunately, he ended 
up leaving. And I guess I ended up leaving with 
him, because, you know, your father. You pretty 
much you gotta go to but yeah.  
So, years later, I never worked in a in a 
restaurant, so to speak. I was a bouncer in 
several different nightclubs in it, in college, 
out of college, in the Atlanta area, but the very 
first position in a restaurant as a an adult was 
as a bar back at a I was a bar back at this 
little nightclub called spin in Atlanta, and then 
I was at that point, basically, I got tired of 
making pennies being a bounce to risk in my life 
every night. And so, I found out how much 
bartenders were making, yeah, at the time. So, I 
ended up enrolling in a bartender academy. Got my 
bartender certification, certified mixologist. 
This is in Atlanta. And then after that, I became 
full time at a restaurant, at a new seafood 
restaurant, as a bartender, and then I got 
another job at a more food to table, I guess, 
farm to table, excuse me, farm to table 
restaurant. And that was a great experience, 
because they had a very advanced bar menu. I 
learned all the classic cocktails we were making, 
Sazerac, old fashions, you name it. 
Sams: Is that a pretty popular restaurant? 
Randall: Oh yes, called the Pig and the Pearl, but it was a 
very prominent restaurant in Atlantic Station. So 
yeah, worked there. Then I was a bartender at the 
lobby bar hotel, uh, with the 12 hotels. The 
restaurant was called the Lobby Bar. This is a 
very prominent bar in West Midtown, Atlanta. Uh, 
that particular hotel would, uh, served a lot of 
their guests would be in the entertainment 
industry, and so I've had a lot of lot of names 
that the frequent lease out of my bar where they 
were staying at the hotel for like, an extensive 
period of time, and I would serve them on a 
nightly basis. And yeah, so I was able to 
basically take my expertise, or my experience 
being the son of a chef, because my dad had a 
catering business when I was in grade school. 
And, you know, I've been making crab cakes since 
I was like seven, peeling shrimp since I was like 
six or seven, you know. So, been doing this stuff 
my whole life. So it was, it was the guess it was 
that time for me to utilize those, those 
inherited skills and apply that to my profession 
in the restaurant business, but quite frankly, it 
was actually the entertainment industry, and me 
being an actor is what enticed me to be in the 
restaurant business, because I had really no 
interest prior to that.  
But you know, as an actor, you have to be 
available on nights and weekends. You have to 
really, excuse me, you have to be available 
during the day to audition. So, you gotta 
normally work on nights and weekends. And so that 
was what brought me to that. And I eventually 
worked at a couple of places, and I ended up 
being a bar manager at a restaurant called 
Atlantis, and ironically, that's where I met my 
wife, and so here we are. Super cool. It was 
about nine years ago.
Sams: Super cool. I appreciate you talking about your 
experience leading you where you're at today. So, 
going back to like, the bar aspects of it, what 
was the like, the biggest struggle that you would 
encounter?
Randall: The biggest struggle that I encountered, was, 
normally, management. Yeah, I -- I live by the 
philosophy how you do anything is how you do 
everything. And unfortunately, other than the Pig 
and the Pearl experience. A lot of my experiences 
when I was a bartender, you didn't have that 
consistent leadership. And so there wasn't that 
quality of service across the board. There wasn't 
a standard, you understand I'm saying so like, if 
I come and I make an old fashioned, if two other 
bartenders after me, who I work with, make that 
same old fashioned, all three of them shouldn't 
taste differently, yeah, you know? And I was by 
the book, you know, I wasn't a I didn't cut 
corners. So, I was very particular and precise 
about how my because that's a reflection of me, 
how it takes and so I took pride in that, you 
know, that was my livelihood at the time. And so, 
I just -- I didn't really appreciate when you 
have bartender's cut corners. If you know me, I 
hear you for sure, lack of professionalism, but 
you know, so --
Sams: Yeah, I got you. And. Yeah, if I'm not mistaken, you 
ended up in LA for a little bit. You kind of 
bartending as well out there.
Randall: Yeah. So, prior to Sheree and I getting married, 
my having our son, Joey, we left Atlanta at the 
end of 2016 and we did some traveling for a few 
months, and we officially moved to LA. Well, back 
to LA for me, first time for my wife. But yeah, 
we were in we lived in Koreatown, but I was 
working at a French fine dining restaurant in 
historic downtown Los Angeles. I worked there for 
about six months. They had a very intense menu. 
Yeah, I was the brunch bartender, literally every 
Sunday by myself. That was pretty good on the 
brunch time --
Sams: Yeah?
Randall: Well, it was an all-inclusive brunch. It was kind 
of a gift and a curse. It was, it was a gift 
because, you know, it afforded me the opportunity 
to make sure our rent was paid. Yeah, every 
month. But it was also a curse in that the 
management were foreigners, and they didn't quite 
understand the dynamic of running a restaurant in 
Los Angeles and the kind the clientele and like, 
if you don't set boundaries and parameters very 
specific about what is expected from a brunch, 
then people will obviously get over. And so, when 
you have brunch starting at 11, yeah, and you 
have the same people sitting in the restaurant 
until three, yeah, because we have Bottomless 
mimosas tables and bottomless belief, you know, 
Bellinis and we had a, was a brunch buffet. Oh, 
okay, right. And so, it was just like, it was 
just completely and we would throw out so much 
food at the end of every now, I would literally 
get these big old to go boxes. Yeah, that was 
leave, and I would go give it to homeless people 
on the super cool because, you know, it's 
homeless capital of America. Oh, yeah. So, I 
would literally, they would be good. So, they 
mean, like, you know, smoked salmon, yeah, with 
lox and bagels and French tarts [unclear]
Sams: Yeah, that says a lot about, who you are. Man, that's 
super cool.
Randall: I appreciate that. It was, I just hate to see all 
that food go to waste and there's people 
literally a block away starving. Yeah, because, 
you know, if you feed anyone who's familiar with 
historic Los Angeles, that particular location 
just a few blocks from Skid Row, which is like a 
very notorious homeless community, yeah, but 
yeah, so yeah, that was, that was my experience 
there. After that restaurant, I had decided that 
I wanted to take a break from the restaurant 
business, and so I started working for this very 
renowned hospitality company that pretty much did 
all of the private corporate parties and private 
house parties at the various celebrities. You 
know, I've been in a lot of who's who people not 
to drop names. But you know, the car did two 
Kardashian Christmas parties two years in a row 
with every A-Lister you can think of, not only in 
the building, but at my bar. I've been to Dr 
Dre's house, Lawrence fish burns house, Dan 
Bilzerian house. Did a Blum house Halloween party 
back in 2018 we also did a Real Housewives of 
Orange County Halloween party. The Saban films 
family, that home.
Sams: I mean - you -- you've been in some super cool 
experience. 
Randall: Yes, it was some pretty interesting experiences. 
Sams: Yeah. So, do you think like working in the restaurant 
industry, kind of showing the hospitality that 
you did there kind of helped you land that job as 
a private kind of bartender?
Randall: Absolutely, absolutely, because I'm coming from, 
like a fine dining experience, because a lot of 
times you'll have these mobile bartenders who 
work in hospitality, no disrespect, but a lot of 
them haven't had the restaurant training. Yeah, 
haven't worked with a very demanding General 
Manager or bar manager, and or have had to deal 
with volume, while also have to serve guests in 
front of you, and I've had to do it all. You 
know, it wasn't. It wasn't. It was in a situation 
where it was rare that on a Thursday through 
Friday, Thursday through Saturday afternoon or 
evening, I would literally get some of the 
restaurants that I worked at in Atlanta. We had a 
30 top at the bar, and I would have a third of 
them just there to see me, and we have like three 
or four bartenders working you. You know? And 
then, but when I worked at the lobby bar, when I 
went on during the week, Sunday through Wednesday 
night, there's only one bartender working, and so 
I would literally have -- that's the 18 top. I'd 
have the whole bar packed out by myself, still 
making drinks, taking orders, making wine 
pairings and food pairings. And, yeah, you know, 
yeah. So, it's so, when I get to, like, the 
hospitality, catering aspect of it, it, it 
definitely served me well. Being a certified 
mixologist, being able to make anything from 
scratch with anything. Someone asked me, yeah, 
can you make something sweet? Sure. And just kind 
of get an idea of the flavor profile, what kind 
of flavors they like to be right there on the 
spot make them the best drink they've ever had in 
their life.
Sams: That's super awesome. And so did the speed of the 
game, I guess, kind of slow down for you once you 
left the restaurant industry. 
Randall: Yeah, yeah. well, you're dealing with a situation 
where you're not making quite as extravagant 
drinks for the most part, but every now and 
again, you know, someone wants you to wow them. 
But now the experience definitely it's good to 
have had a nice Arsenal on my tool belt. You 
know, I got you like the Batman bartender, if you 
will, got to, you know, coming with the little 
different, different tools and whatnot. And like, 
I worked in every aspect of this business. I've 
been a, when I was a bar back, you know, when the 
dishwasher didn't show up, who you think was in 
the kitchen cleaning the dishes till three in the 
morning, yours truly. So, I worked in every 
aspect of this industry, so there's nothing 
that's too grimy for me. Yeah, nothing. I take 
out. I had to take out the trash. I've had to do 
all of the side work you could possibly think of. 
So, when I see, you know, bartender's service 
that have this level of arrogance that they don't 
have to do side work. It's comical to me.
Sams: Yeah, sure, because that's the thing like for 
successful business like that. I mean, 
everybody's got to be full hands on. I mean if 
you want everything to be flowing all hands on, 
yeah, exactly. So, um, how did you stay organized 
and like, manage your time effectively when you 
were preparing all these drinks and stuff. 
Randall: That's an excellent question. Well, let me ask you 
a question. Are you talking about in the 
restaurant business? Are you talking about 
catering? Because the dynamic, the dynamics' a 
little bit different. Because the reason why I 
asked about restaurant, it depends on me, am I 
doing service? Am I on service bar? Yeah, serving 
guests. Because if I'm just serving guests, and I 
have a little bit more time I gotcha to, you 
know, you know, do a little extra something, 
something. But when I have service, I'm wearing a 
couple different hats, because now I gotta make 
sure that the drinks are getting out. Drinks are 
getting out to the servers before they start 
blowing a head gasket, and I still got to take 
care of the people in front of me. So I just 
though I we would have various systems like, for 
instance, if you're on service, you always want 
to make sure that whatever, let's say, for 
instance, we receive a ticket and we got beer on 
it, wine on it, and some type of cocktail, you 
always do the cocktails first, yeah, you know, 
why is that? Well, because you always want to do 
the most challenging aspect first. You want to 
knock that out. Yeah, what you do is, I would 
always get my glasses set up. So, if I got a 
ticket, if I have a cocktail that's in the tall, 
got my tall if I got in a rocks glass, got my 
rice glass ready, prepared if it's some 
champagne. I got my flute, red wine, or white 
wine, we got different glasses, depending on the 
restaurant. If we have a beer, I got my 16-pint 
glass, so I have all my glasses lined up. I got 
the ticket right here, and so it's like 
clockwork. 
Sams: Do you -- going back to you talking about your 
college football experience, do you think that 
kind of, like, the hard work and stuff, that 
discipline --
Randall: Yeah, and I'll be honest with you, you know, a lot 
of people that I worked in the industry. A lot of 
them might have artistic backgrounds, some people 
just maybe a business background, but I could 
always tell who was successful at their passion 
or their craft based on their work ethic. At 
work, like I said, how you do anything is how you 
do everything. The people who were very 
professional, they were on time. Their appearance 
was on point. They didn't cut corners. They had 
integrity. They had accountability. Me that word 
accountability. It's crazy, it's funny. It's like 
when, even today, when I go to a restaurant and 
something's wrong with our order, I always have 
an idea of what happened, and when your food 
doesn't come out nine times out of 10 is because 
the server did not ring something in on the POS, 
and so I appreciate when a server is honest with 
us and less as though I apologize I forgot to put 
it in. I'll take care of it. Accountability, 
accountability, yeah, but when you have a server 
who's not accountable, and then they'll lie, or 
they'll try to blame it on the kitchen. Yeah, 
that right there. I have zero tolerance for but, 
you know, I'm saying I won't make a scene or 
fuss, yeah, but I will remember that, and that is 
integrity. I live by the model in tech, 
integrity, loyalty, honor, respect, and 
accountability. Yeah, those five attributes, like 
without one of them, is, I can't do it, kind of 
core pillars. Oh, yeah. Excuse my French -- You 
take one of them away. You ain't got shit. Yes, 
exactly, exactly, those core values and they're 
not. They're non-negotiable.
Randall: I hope I answered your question, yeah,
Sams: No, I appreciate that, yeah, going into the next one, 
how did you like taking care of everybody? You 
were talking about how you were taking care of up 
to 18 people, sometimes more, like, how did you 
make sure you were getting to everybody and like 
a mannerly like time and like --
Randall: First off, another rule of thumb. And I see this a 
lot in restaurants today. I don't care what 
you're doing when you're behind the bar. I don't 
care what you're doing if you're certain tables, 
the moment someone is sat at a table, you greet 
them, you enter, you come by, you introduce 
yourself, you let them know. I am currently 
working on a guest. I come over. But what you 
want to do is, if you can give them some water 
and give them a menu, I see it all the time, 
someone should not wait more than 30 seconds 
without having a menu in front of them, yeah? 
Because what happens is you're wasting their 
time. Because think about -- why do people go to 
restaurants? Why does anyone go to any 
restaurant? It is because they want to be treated 
like a king or queen Yeah or prince or princess, 
otherwise, they could just go home and cook for 
themselves. So, I come from a very hospitable 
family. We were the household that did all of the 
holidays that involved like food, the 
Thanksgivings, the Christmases, the New Year's 
Eve parties, cookout season, uh, whether or they 
were even before cookout season, Easter, fourth 
in July. Labor Day, Memorial Day, food makes 
people happy. My father was on the grill. I was 
me, and my brother was help prepping. Yeah, my 
sister was doing something. My mom was doing 
something. And this is the family tradition. So, 
you're in a hospitable you're in a hospitality 
business. Be hospitable. Yeah, they're a guest 
like, treat them like you're they're a guest at 
your own home. And everybody who sits in front of 
me. The reason why they come back because I treat 
them like a friend or family member, and they 
want to come back, and usually when they come 
back, they're bringing a friend, exactly, super 
cool.
Sams: So, what do you do in situations like because, 
obviously you've had to have an encounter, like a 
customer that gets upset. How do you like when 
you're faced with adversity like that? Like, 
what's your -- are you focusing?
Randall: The first thing I do is I try to be an empathetic 
listener. Okay, try to not make it about me. Try 
to really listen to the core root of what it is 
they want. Because a lot of people, when they're 
upset, they have a difficult time articulating 
what they want. So, you got to listen, Oh, yeah. 
You got to listen to the core root cause and what 
that is. So, once you find what that is, and take 
all the fat off of it, and don't make it 
emotional, find that what that one thing that you 
know is gonna make their day. And I've turned too 
many, so many frowns upside down, like you 
wouldn't even believe it, and it just showing a 
little bit and be humorous too. It's okay. Have 
fun with them, like let them know that you 
sincerely are sad. We're not sad, but you 
sincerely want to make it right, yeah, and if 
they notice, you sincerely. You want to make it 
right, regardless if you're wrong or not, because 
sometimes it won't even be something that myself 
or my colleagues. Did we mess up? Yeah, you just 
did a little difficult, but sometimes things 
happen. Yeah, exactly. But we're accountable 
about it, we're sincere about it, and we want to 
get it right. And at that point, if you're 
working at a decent establishment, lot of times 
bartenders will have a tab, yeah, so give us 
something complimentary on the house. Yeah? You 
know, if it's something sometimes people the 
moment is ruined and they don't want to order 
that anymore, we'll go find out what else they 
can what else you can give and turn that how can 
we make that experience amazing. I think those 
managers that are able to don't look at as a look 
at every challenge is also an opportunity. That's 
so if you look at it as conflict, a situation 
where you just want to run away, well now you 
miss an opportunity to grow. This is an 
opportunity, because what happens is that 
disgruntled customer, you can turn it and now 
there'll be a lifelong customer. These are the 
people they're going to be on Yelp. And you know 
those yelps, boom, boom, boom, the ones that tell 
the truth about it. First, we had a relationship, 
but so and so was so amazing. Blah, blah, blah, 
blah, blah, like people can, because every 
experience is not going to be perfect. And, you 
know, I try to be patient, but as long as I know 
the person that is genuine and they are sincere 
and that actually give a damn, or they care the 
people I can work with, even if the food isn't 
amazing, at least, you know, the serve, you know, 
I'm saying I'm not going to penalize the server 
and the kitchen, you know, yeah, for sure. 
Sometimes things happen. Sometimes depending on 
the restaurants you go to, depending on the time 
of day, depending on who's in the kitchen. 
Sometimes it's like I was talking about a dream. 
Sometimes the food might not taste the same. So 
sometimes you might be dealing with some 
inexperienced servers who are just overwhelmed 
and wheezing, and they're letting their food stay 
on the line too long, yeah, and they're over 
cooking. That's why the kitchen, when that bell 
rings and that food is ready that you expect it 
to be served, yeah, that's why I like those 
restaurants where it's a like a team environment, 
where it's not like every man for itself, like so 
if they, if you're one of your teammates, know 
that you, you kind of got a large table, you over 
one you got somebody will come run your food for 
you. And if it's, if a cold server won't do as a 
manager, somebody run the food. Yeah, get this 
food out of here, because the worst thing you 
want to do is order a steak or a flaky fish 
that's overcooked when it's supposed to be served 
medium Exactly. That's, it's no good. It ruins 
the experience for everyone. 
Sams: Yeah, I'm a server at a restaurant, and that's, 
that's one thing that, like, if I could give 
feedback to where I work at, it's -- it's not 
like, necessarily a team environment. That's the 
thing. Like, I'll be taking care of an 8 top or 
so, and like, your food would just be sitting 
there, or your drinks hop over here, and 
everybody just wants to walk by, and nobody wants 
to help, but when it's me, you know, I'm helping 
them. And reciprocity, yeah, and people want to 
know, like, why do I do so good? It's because, 
you know, I'm a hard worker. I want to make sure; 
you know hot food. You're getting your hot food, 
your drinks, not sitting up there, not being 
cold, and before you're drinking your ice. And 
nobody wants that.
Randall: Speak, preach my brother, preach. 
Sams: I'm getting into, it's -- the little things, man.
Randall: It's just, like, just, I like, to give a damn man, 
yeah. It's like, when you when you have, I like 
wearing those places where it's like, I'm a 
servant leader. Okay, you know? I mean, I'm not. 
I think sometimes when, when you work for the 
servant leaders, though, those are the best type 
of leaders to work for, is you want to run 
through, run through a wall for them. But we get 
around those supreme dictator, delegators that'll 
walk past empty glass, run around, tell the bar 
back to go pick it up. Just pick it up.
Sams: Yeah, just pick it up. We go here to GM. But my thing 
is, like, you're preaching it at us that we're 
supposed to be doing --
Randall: That the bar back with the bottom of the barrel, 
whoever's the lowest ranked person at that 
establishment sees the person who's the highest 
ranked person in that establishment, or the 
owner, or whoever, see you doing the dirty work, 
then they have no excuse. Exactly, they have no 
excuse, is -- you set the example, you set the 
tone. It's the servant leader. So, when I see 
going, I go in a restaurant and I see tables, and 
it's a table full of empty glasses, and it just 
sitting there and open, unattended to. That's a 
reflection of management.
Sams: Yeah, it's also how, like, that's how I make my 
money. You got to turn these tables quick. Get 
more people to come in, sit down. And that's how 
you're making your bread, right? So, quick, and 
easy, but yeah, let's -- What was your favorite 
drink to make, whenever you were bartending? I'm 
sure there was a bunch of different concoctions. 
Randall: That's my guess because I have a couple babies. 
Okay, so back in the summer of 2015 I had, had 
created this old separate Instagram page. My 
nickname was called the Muddle Man, any drink 
that required me to muddle, and actually, that 
particular summer when I was working at the lobby 
bar, my recipe for the spicy mango margarita won 
the best margarita contest at Atlantic Station. 
So, I'm big into muddling, but I think my most 
popular drink of all time would have to be a 
cocktail by the name of what's called a Medusa. 
And it's green so basically it's a martini in a 
martini glass, you take about two ounces of I 
used to do it with Tito's vodka, two ounces of 
Tito's vodka, about a half ounce of lemon juice. 
Later, it got switched to lime juice when, when I 
first started the drink was lemon juice. We would 
do about a half ounce of Saint Germain, get that 
elder flower liquor in there. It's a great 
pairing. You know, we would have sugar cubes. If 
I had it, I would muddle it. I prefer sugar cubes 
over simple syrup. Oh, yeah. So, I would do sugar 
cubes, or if I had agave now, if I was doing it 
now, I would probably use agave instead of sugar, 
but yeah, so you get that nice the way we would 
do it. And I learned this at the Pig and the 
Pearl. Before we add the liquor, we build the 
base. Some people do it back up. Some people put 
the liquor in the mixing glass first. Then they 
starting off, I would muddle everything together, 
then I would pour the liquor in there, and then I 
would let it, the juices form around the liquor, 
and so - it's flavor. So, I'm doing that before I 
had the ice. And so, then I had the ice, I get 
that shake, and then I would, you know, have it 
in the Martini, and it's just got this beautiful 
green. I have to show you a photograph. I think I 
have it somewhere this green, and then I would 
take the cucumber. Oh, I'm tripping. I forgot the 
most important part. This is a Cucumber Martini. 
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm muddling cucumber. Okay, 
that's this. That's the first thing I put in 
there. I'm forgive me. So yeah, I start with the 
with the slices of cucumber. Okay, then I take my 
lemon juice, my sugar cube, then I build that 
base. So, I got a cucumber, I got the lemon juice 
later on, and I got to, you know, the sugar cubes 
of building that base. I had the Tito's. Then I 
add the saint, I had it all together. And then I 
keep muddling. I muddle it some more, yeah. Then 
I add the ice, get that nice shape, and then put 
that in that martini, guys, I'm telling you about 
what made it so it's a drink if I made one, just 
one, yeah, I don't care if it was for service or 
for guests, if I had high tops around the bar and 
people at the bar, every female in the building, 
yeah. And it was a gift and a curse because I 
knew as soon as I made one, I was like, Damn the 
service ticket would sound like Chitty, Chitty, 
bang, bang, yeah. Medusa, Medusa, Medusa, Medusa, 
Medusa, Medusa, so --
Sams: You got it down to the T --
Randall: Oh, man, it was like Medusa, actually, when I was 
the bar manager, because I perfected this drink 
at the Lord the lobby bar. But when I was hired 
as a bar manager, that was actually a drink that 
I had put on the menu at Atlantis, and just like 
it was at all the other spots, it was very 
popular drink, yeah, but yeah, the Medusa that 
was then when last restaurant I worked before we 
left Atlanta was the bar taco off of Howard mill, 
and once again, the Medusa. So that was oh, and 
then the garnish. So, I would take these skewers, 
and I would take the roll up cucumbers, and I put 
them on a roll, and they would just sit right on 
top of the Martin.
Sams: So, it sounds like a super, like, refreshing. 
Randall: So refreshing. Yeah, no, get twisted. The ladies 
wasn't just drinking, too, the dudes was 
drinking, too.
Sams: Yeah, super cool. So, getting outside the restaurant 
a little bit, you've been out of the industry 
for. A few years now, right? So, what are you 
doing now that you're outside of the industry? 
Randall: I'm a tour manager. I work for various marketing 
agencies who have a very high profile client. I 
can't name the clients that I'm on now because 
it's in the tobacco industry. There are some very 
particular things that I'm charming starting to 
get accustomed to. But last year I was primarily 
-- I worked with an organization, and their 
client was Coca Cola. And so, we did. We had a 
national football tour. We had all the fall 
football games in the southwestern region and 
some in the Midwestern region. And then we've 
concluded that year with a holiday tour. Early in 
the year, we did the Women's College World 
Series. I was, actually -- was working with power 
rate for that and the Women's College final, 
Women's Final Four in Dallas. Ironically, I did 
get to see Caitlin Clark, big name in the 
championship game. I saw that a year ago. Got a 
chance to see that last 22 is a crazy year 
because, you know, then we were in Oklahoma and 
the Oklahoma women's softball team, you know, 
they had that record streak, and they won the 
national championship. Well, yeah, that was a 
pretty big you also did state farm tour. Passing 
out bobblehead dolls. So, yeah, that's, I love 
what we get to, same approach that I had in the 
restaurant businesses now that, you know, I make 
sure that anyone who comes by our footprint, 
depending on whatever we're sampling, well, we're 
not sampling on the tobacco, because we can't 
sample tobacco, you know, we sell it, but it's 
all about providing thrilling, exhilarating 
experiences to whomever, adult, previously, 
families now, just 21 or older adults, either 
because it's tobacco. Well, yeah, it's just this, 
you know, making whoever, our guests of our 
footprint, make them want to stay a while or make 
them want to come back and bring somebody with 
them. You know? Yeah, I hear real experiences. 
So, it's the same approach. Still a servant 
leader, just like I was when I was a bar manager. 
Now, as a tour manager, I worked in every just 
like I worked in every single aspect, all 
connected, all speaking, sometimes you'll do 
spirits. And actually, my foot in this industry 
was as a mixologist with a company called MKTG, 
okay, and I launched the this brand of single 
grain Scotch whiskey that was headed by the face 
of it was David Beckham, okay, they needed some 
very strong, masculine type, present males that I 
was in a three piece suit at the Atlanta 
International Airport, duty free sampling Scotch 
to all of the international travelers. So that 
was a great experience. I got a chance to meet 
people from literally all over the world, Brazil, 
Toronto, Japan, Spain, Middle East, you name it. 
They were coming. They were in there, and they 
all hung out with me and got to try this guy's. 
Oh yeah, absolutely, oh yeah.
Sams: Kind of full, like, full 360 that was kind of a main 
thing we talked about this class, is Coke. And 
that's because my professor, she's from Mexico 
City, okay? And beginning of the class, she was 
like, Yeah, Coke's a big selling product because 
the water is not, like, purified safely and stuff 
and Cokes, like a big name drink out in different 
countries. And I thought that was super cool. So, 
I don't know if you have any intake on that, or?
Randall: No, that's, that's, that's, that's good to know 
that. Oh, it is global, right? Yeah, yeah. It's 
crazy, because, you know, in certain areas of the 
world, certain regions of the country, soda. 
Instead of saying soda, they say Coke, yeah, but 
they, but not necessarily, just mean, like a 
Cola. They can mean any type of soda. I need a 
Coke, but they mean soda. But that's, that's how 
much of the market share of soda that coke has, 
of course, you have Pepsi and these other 
competitors, but it's how I feel like
Sams: Coke's always gotta be on top. 
Randall: Oh yeah. I mean, they Coca Cola smile, yeah, 
exactly. I mean, what do you think -- who brought 
his Santa Claus? Coca Cola? Oh yeah, Santa Claus, 
the whole, you know, having a little Santa people 
sit on Santa's lap and yeah, during the holidays 
that started, I think it was in the 50s. I think 
you still kind of see some commercials like that, 
right? Santa's got the coke in his hand saying, 
yeah. Coca Cola made Santa a global icon.
Sams: I did not know that, super cool.
Randall: I mean, he was around before. That wasn't like 
marketing. From a marketing standpoint, Coca Cola 
made Santa Claus.
Sams: I got you so getting down to, got a few minutes left, 
getting down to the last few questions. Here, how 
do you spend your free time now? What do you? 
What do you like to enjoy outside of work. 
Randall: Obviously because I travel a lot, whenever I'm 
home, spending as much time with my family. I 
have a four-year-old who's absolutely amazing. 
He's -- we have him in Taekwondo. He does that a 
couple times a week. Just got him in soccer. He's 
home schooled. So, I try to spend as much time 
with him as possible. His mother watches Moby 
from the house. And so, whenever I'm home, I try 
to, you know, give her a little break, because 
she's managing, yeah, working remotely while 
being mommy at the same time. So, I try to give 
her, you know, some relief in that regard. 
Outside of that, I work out. I work out when I'm 
home, definitely seven days a week. Now, when I 
want to roll, that's a little difficult, just 
because of the sometimes we have early mornings, 
like, for instance, this Saturday in Austin, we 
have to be on site at 5am so that's going to kind 
of interfere with the workout schedule, but 
definitely when I'm home, I'm up 4AM Monday 
through Friday. I get up at 5AM Friday, Saturday, 
and Sunday, but my workouts set the tone for the 
rest of my day. Yeah, I was a competitive boxer 
for eight years, and so I still have that kind 
of, that fighters mentality, and that keeps me I 
benefit like Benjamin Button. I feel like I'm 
aging backwards. Literally. I look at pictures 
from 10 to 15 years ago, and I looked myself in 
the mirror. I'm like, how so when I post, like a 
photograph or something on social media, which is 
not all things, I don't really it's not as active 
as I used to be. But when I see, you know, people 
I went to high school, we college with, and some 
of them are, like, two, three to four, five years 
younger than me and I look younger than them, 
yeah, or people 10 years younger than me ,and I 
look younger than him. But I know I'm doing 
something, right? So, it's the lifestyle, you 
know, yeah, man, I just know I try to, try to 
eat, right, you know, have good energy. Just 
laugh, man, yeah. But some of the things I got 
covered in on the buff of this that definitely 
scratch off this year. My birthday, I got a 
chance to do skydiving. Soon. I don't think that 
-- I'm gonna, be honest this summer. This summer, 
sooner than later, I already have a place here in 
Dallas that I've already found. I'm gonna do it. 
I've seen -- there's a couple tour managers. Then 
I went to training in Milwaukee as a young lady. 
She then said she's done over 200 jumps, so she's 
getting ready to be able to be certified to jump 
by herself without a assistance. So that's 
awesome when scuba dive. Definitely do some deep, 
deep, deep diving. Want to get into some 
freshwater fishing like saltwater fishing Yeah, 
and I went fishing for the first time in a very 
long time when, say it was the end of '22 but 
definitely want to do some fishing. Hunting is 
something that I'm obsessed with. Fortunately, a 
couple times I had an opportunity to go this 
year, the trip got canceled due to increment 
weather. Is it something happens to some of the 
time it was off, but not on the tour season right 
now, it's gonna be able to challenge. Able to 
challenge it come this fall. I gotta get me a 
white tail deer. That's the thing about that 
food, though, is you know exactly where it's 
coming from as a deer, I mean, that's one of the, 
you know, healthiest food. Oh, speaking of, I we 
adopt. We adopted this lifestyle that we only eat 
game meat, yeah, and fresh, you know, wild caught 
fish. Well, for the most part, okay, obviously 
you go to a restaurant, yeah, at the mercy what's 
on the menu. So, I usually, when I go to a 
restaurant, for the most part, I just order fish, 
unless they have maybe some imported lamb chops 
from either Australia or New Zealand. 
Unfortunately, not to burst anyone's bubble. 97% 
of food here, here in America is banned in the 
EU, you know -- not to get political, because I'm 
not a political person. But regardless of how 
people feel about Putin, he's got one thing, 
right. He considers anyone who produces 
genetically modified ingredients in this country 
a domestic terrorist. Yeah, so there is 
absolutely no manufacturing. There's no food that 
consists of GMOs in Russia. Yeah, I think that's 
also kind of you wonder why their kids excel at 
an early age, you know? But like I said, I don't 
want to get political. I want -- a ruffle 
feathers by saying something. Ruffle feathers by 
saying something about Putin. I'm just talking 
about -- 
Sams: No, I hear you. Yeah. 
Randall: So yeah, game me. So that's one of the reasons why 
I'm midway between the workouts and the food 
proper hydration.
Sams: Yeah, I got you. So last question to kind of wrap 
things up, what's next for Jay? Into, what's next 
on the agenda here,
Randall: My objective in in the next one to three years is 
to successfully replace my income as a tour 
manager with passive income. Now, that's not to 
say I'm just going to quit, yeah, but I would 
like for my profession to be optional. I got you. 
But with that freedom, I want to be able to own 
my own time. And with that, I would like to, 
well, first of all, how is that going to happen? 
Investing real estate is definitely something 
that's this. This a high priority outside of 
that, since we're on the topic long term, I have 
a vision to be a restaurant owner. Okay, yeah, I 
have a couple concepts.
Sams: What would we what would you specialize in the 
restaurant? 
Randall: I would like to have a steak house, okay, that 
specializes in game meats, okay?
Sams: And how would you -- would you work with other 
businesses? Or would you kind of be, like, the 
solo, like, kind of, yeah, Nomad, kind of --
Randall: We would start with, obviously, our staple 
restaurant, maybe would be developed into a 
group, a restaurant group, but we would like to 
make the food. In other words, we want to serve 
things that are local, okay? And we want to have 
game meats that are coming from their natural 
habitat. And so, if we're have a restaurant here 
in the Texas area, obviously we want to have game 
meats that are local to Texas. If we have 
something near some streams of water. So, we have 
freshwater fish, it would be coming from here. If 
we have saltwater fish, it would come from the 
Gulf. But we want to keep it local. Okay, I don't 
want to have anything imported. 
Sams: Would you like to eventually be a chain or kind of 
just like a one chain, just a group --
Randall: Restaurant Group, nothing too big, because I feel 
like the larger you get, the harder it is to 
maintain the core values. I'm not this is 
something like, like to honor my father and 
things that he's been able to accomplish in his 
career, and to, you know, have a restaurant, 
something like a partner with him. I guess, may 
or may not be that that particular concept, but 
definitely some type of concept where he and I 
can work together on a project. So that's in the 
other thing aspect is I like to have always 
wanted to own my own boxing gym. Okay, so I have 
a concept for a to frame that as you could be 
something like a franchise, you know, sorry, 
small box boxing gym situation. 
Sams: That's, that's a big thing like nowadays too, is like 
combat sports, I definitely think that's like the 
next up and coming thing. I mean, they were the 
Ryan Haney or the Haney-Garcia fight. I mean, 
that was one of the biggest boxing events of all 
time. That was most viewers and stuff. And combat 
sports, I definitely think is the next up and 
coming thing. 
Randall: I just don't advocate it for kids that are too, 
too young. Boxing, my son takes Taekwondo, but 
it's -- he's hitting. He's kicking boards and 
pads and things of that nature. There's no 
sparring. Yeah, at this age, though I've done 
some extensive research, I was fortunate, because 
I got into boxing later in life, I was a month 
before my 31st birthday, never went pro, so I 
pretty much spar with headgear. You know, even in 
amateur boxing now, they've gotten rid of their 
head gear. Oh, yeah. And so, I'm saying this from 
the standpoint being a former football player, 
having former teammates at collegiate level they 
played professionally, that some of them could 
potentially have. CTE? Yeah, combat sports, you 
put your the kid is even at a higher risk of 
acquiring CTE later in life than even someone who 
plays football, but the earlier a kid plays 
football, like pop one, I'll be honest with you, 
pop one has expiration date on Oh, that's why the 
NFL has put so much money in the flag football is 
the reason is that they're getting ready to phase 
Pop Warner Football out. So don't be surprised 
here in the next five or 10 years where there's 
no more attack of football, oh, yeah, until kids 
get to high school. Well, that's the thing I like 
--
Sams: Well, that's the thing? What's the age that your 
brain is still developing?
Randall: I think all the way up to like, 12 or 14? Yeah? 
These are adolescents. Yeah, the kids under the 
like, six eight, even though it's great to look 
at, is very impressive. Like, oh, they can hit 
the mitts. Oh, yeah, sure, but there's no reason 
why a six-year-old is sparring, yeah, going blow 
for blow in a boxing arena. It's just there's no 
you. Yes, he could win a gold medal, but at what 
cost?
Sams: Yeah, you gotta look at the long term. 
Randall: Yeah, my son's most valuable asset is his brain. 
Yeah, functioning, his capability. It's, it's who 
he is. It's not what he can do. Yeah, for sure. 
Now what can what he can do, is important, but 
it's why I should say what he could do. It's not 
what he looks like. It's not just his athletic 
ability, like I feel like, unfortunately, in this 
country, we certain demographics. We only want to 
celebrate their athletic prowess, yeah, but we 
don't keep that same amount of energy. You know, 
highlighting their intellectual capacity, their 
character, things of that nature. So, for my son, 
you know, it's, I want him to be well rounded, 
you know. So, he's going to be extremely 
enormous, like I'm six four with boots on. He's 
probably going to be taller than me. So, I'm not 
going to sit here and say he's not going to play 
athletics. You must. Athletics, of course, he's 
going to dominate, of course, for sure, and 
that's another reason why I want to own my own 
time, because I want to be the one coaching. 
Yeah, you know, I don't, you know type one. I 
know No, but like, when it comes to a team sport, 
soccer, he's in soccer. I don't know anything 
about soccer. I got him in soccer right now. But 
if he ends up playing, like, basketball or 
baseball or flag football, I'm going to be 
coaching, oh yeah, because the competition and 
it's just it's gotten out of hand, particularly 
with, you know, AAU basketball in this country, 
Little League Baseball, it's like a whole 'nother 
League. Well, you got too many parents trying to 
recreate. They're trying to live their lives 
through their kids. They're trying to breed 
professional athletes when they're in 
kindergarten. Let them be a kid. Yeah, I know I 
got all tangled, but yeah, no, you're good. 
Sams: That basically, pretty much sums up everything that I 
want to get to talk to you about today. I 
appreciate your time, answered a lot of questions 
today. But yeah, good talking to you, man.
Randall: Thank you, bro. I appreciate it. 
Sams: Of course.
