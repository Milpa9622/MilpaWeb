Morgan Koiner: Good evening to anyone who is listening. My 
name is Morgan Koiner, and it is currently 6pm in 
Denton, Texas on May 1, 2024, I am excited to 
introduce you to Max Marquez. Max has been 
working in the food industry for around four 
years now. And he has a passion for not only 
cooking but serving delicious food to friends, 
family and customers. Max, thank you for being 
here today with me. The first question I want to 
ask you is where are you from?

Max Marquez: Thanks for having me. I'm from Dallas, Texas. 
I was born in Abilene, but I was raised in 
Dallas. It's a great city. Great culture, 
awesome. Food. It's deeply influenced me for my 
love for food and cooking.

Morgan Koiner: When did you become passionate about food? 
And did anyone in particular teach you how to 
cook?

Max Marquez: I've been passionate about food, cooking for 
as long as I can remember. My grandmother played 
a significant role in sparking that passion. From 
a young age, I'd watch her effortlessly create 
awesome food. She had her own recipes. They were 
passed down from her grandparents and their 
grandparents. She always invited me to watch her 
cook and learn and always offered to teach me 
traditional Mexican dishes and techniques. And 
she kind of instilled that love for cooking in 
me.

Koiner: And what was your childhood like growing up? 

Marquez: My childhood in Dallas was very vibrant. I grew up 
in a close knit family. We had a pretty true, I 
wouldn't say traditional Mexican heritage. My dad 
was Mexican; my mom was white. And my 
grandmother, who's my dad's father, was the heart 
of our home, she was always around. She took care 
of me for months when my mom couldn't afford 
daycare. And her kitchen was always busy. I have 
a lot of memories of going over and staying 
weekends with her and just eating awesome food, 
watching her cook. My parents would always leave 
me with her because they were working hard to 
provide, and they would save money on just 
leaving me with her. My grandmother kind of 
instilled a deep appreciation for our culture in 
me and tradition. We had tons of family 
gatherings with so many people. Too many people 
remember too many cousins' stuff like that. I 
really enjoyed my childhood.

Koiner: And I want to ask you something about that. You 
mentioned that your mom is white on your mom's 
side of the family. Right? Um, did she also do 
you know if she also learned any dishes? A part 
of your Mexican heritage on your dad's side? Or 
do you know anything about that? No, definitely 
not. No. Okay. Um, what about your community? 
What was your community and neighborhood like 
outside of your family?

Marquez: Outside my family community Dallas was a mix of 
different cultures and backgrounds, a lot of 
diversity. I grew up in a neighborhood that had 
tons of people from different parts of the world 
and different cultures. It was very different, I 
guess. Everyone was different. So, there was a 
lot of, just -- it's kind of just a melting pot. 
I really enjoyed being a part of such a diverse 
community where everyone brought something unique 
to the table. 

Koiner: Um, did you know any of your neighbors that you 
lived by or anything where you close with them 
like any friends, families that you learned from?

Marquez: My childhood friend Jason, I grew up from him 
across the street, and he has a very traditional 
Mexican household. Both of his parents are 
immigrants. So, it was just whenever I went over 
there, it was constant Spanish being spoken. 
Always Mexican food, nothing anything, nothing 
else. But he was really the only person I was 
close with in my neighborhood.

Koiner: Okay, um, you mentioned your grandmother and her 
family being from Mexico. Does anyone in your 
family make any traditional dishes or special 
dishes for holidays, birthdays, anything like 
that? That, you know of --?

Marquez: Um not on my mom's side. But on my dad's side, 
it's my grandma. She would always make 
traditional Mexican dishes for family gatherings, 
celebrations birthdays. Like I said, the recipes 
were passed down from generations. Like for 
holidays and birthdays, we prepare stuff like 
tamales, guacamole, pozole, enchiladas. It was a 
very easy way to kind of connect with my family. 
But yeah, when I was with her, or whenever we 
were over there, Mexican food was very, that's 
all we would eat.

Koiner: Okay, and I wanted to ask you what was the first 
job that you had?

Marquez: I got my first job at 17 working at a local Tex 
Mex restaurant in Dallas. I started out washing 
dishes, food prep. But I really enjoyed the fast-
paced environment quickly. And then I took the 
opportunity to learn from experienced chefs, and 
it was the perfect introduction to the culinary 
world.

Koiner: How did your career or job skills change over the 
years?

Marquez: Let me think. I mean, they've changed quite a bit 
starting out as just as kind of a kitchen 
assistant doing a lot of the grunt work. Like 
washing dishes and food prep, once I gain more 
experience and confidence, so I took on more 
responsibility, heavy roles, like line cooks. But 
along the way, I honed my culinary skills. I 
learned a bunch of new techniques and kind of 
develop a strong sixth sense in the kitchen.

Koiner: First of all, I wanted to ask you, do you know what 
sustainability is? Yeah. Okay. Um, in any of the 
jobs, food jobs that you worked at, did you or 
the company practice any sustainable ways of 
living? I guess I wanted to ask that because I 
feel like it's pretty relevant in the 21st 
century, you know, a lot of people are starting 
to be sustainable in like, for example, less 
plastic, like paper straws, things like that. So 
yeah. Did you or your company practice anything 
to be more sustainable? Or do you know anything 
about that?

Marquez: Absolutely. Sustainability is really important in 
the culinary world, and the restaurant where I 
work, we take it seriously. We focus on reducing 
food waste, managing inventory, utilizing all the 
ingredients we have we sourced locally whenever 
possible, just kind of help local suppliers and 
stuff like that and reduce our carbon footprint. 
We also try to use sustainable practices like 
energy efficient equipment, ecofriendly 
packaging. It's all about just doing what we can 
to do reduce the waste and make the planet 
greener. 

Koiner: Yeah, I like that. That's great. Um, and speaking 
of waste food waste in particular, what are your 
thoughts on all the food waste that we see from, 
you know, like, fast food chains or restaurants? 
What do you what are your thoughts on that is 
specifically about the food waste in America?

Marquez: I think food waste in America is pretty, it's a 
pretty significant issue and needs to be 
addressed. It's sad to see just a bunch of food 
go to waste when there are people in our 
community and where we live that don't have 
access to food and stuff, just good food, clean 
food or just food at all. Let me think. We just 
try to have a creative menu that can use all the 
ingredients we have that way we don't waste 
anything. And we partner with local organizations 
to donate the food that we don't use to those in 
need.

Koiner: And something else I'm curious about is have you 
ever witnessed yourself seeing food waste, 
whether it was like someone at a place of work 
that you were in or someone else? Like have you 
ever seen food waste, like witnessed that before?

Marquez: For sure. I feel like that goes for anyone working 
in a kitchen. It's just there's always waste in 
general. But it's all about mitigating how much 
waste there is.

Koiner: Right, okay, so I have kind of a fun question. I 
was wondering if you could work at any restaurant 
in the world? Where would that be? And why?

Marquez: Let me think. If I could work in any restaurant 
world, it would probably be a Pujol in Mexican a 
Mexico City. Chef, Chef Enrique Olvera. I don't 
know if you know him or not. He has a pretty 
innovative approach to the Mexican palette and 
Mexican cuisine. Not to mention, I just love the 
opportunity to learn from him and his team and 
just kind of immerse myself in the culinary scene 
of Mexico City.

Koiner: Okay, and are there any chefs in the industry that 
you look up to? And if so, why? 

Marquez: Let me think for a sec. I'm trying to wrack my 
brain here. 

Koiner: That's okay.

Marquez: One chef I have in mind is Jose Andres. He has a 
pretty strong commitment to using food as a force 
for good I guess. He does a lot of humanitarian 
efforts. He has a really innovative approach to 
cooking. He's not afraid to push boundaries in 
the culinary world. And I admire his passion for 
making a positive impact in the world through 
food. Plus, he has a really diverse culinary 
background and a really significant creative 
flair. That makes me kind of drawn to, to him.

Koiner: Okay, um, what would you say are the greatest 
challenges you've faced in your life so far?

Marquez: Let me think, I think one of the greatest 
challenges I've faced in my life is kind of 
finding my identity and having a balance like two 
different cultures or just being biracial. Being 
Mexican and white and kind of balancing being 
having family from Mexico and me also being born 
in America. Growing up, I kind of felt torn 
between two cultures and just had to kind of 
figure out where I fit in. It took a lot of time 
and soul searching, to embrace and kind of accept 
both aspects of my identity. Also, just pursuing 
a career in the culinary industry has had its 
challenges from long hours in the kitchen to just 
how fast paced and competitive it can be. But I 
feel like these challenges, challenges have also 
been an opportunity for growth and learning.

Koiner: Right. What do you envision for the future of the 
food industry? And how do you see yourself 
fitting into that?

Marquez: Um I can't I guess I dream of a future where the 
food industry completely embraces sustainability. 
There's also an aspect of just inclusivity and 
diversity. Because I mean, with a lot of Mex 
Mexican restaurants, the kitchens there are 
typically also just Mexicans like myself. I feel 
like there's room for people of other colors to 
kind of come in and give their own take on it 
because it makes it more unique and just kind of 
rounds it all out. Not to mention where we're not 
only getting our food supplies or just 
ingredients we have or all that stuff from these 
big companies that are all over United States 
that are kind of just like the Target of or 
Walmart of food supply and kind of have a more a 
bigger focus on buying locally. Because it opens 
the door for these local places to kind of 
compete with these big national food supply 
chains like Cisco. I guess I see myself fitting 
in with just sharing my passion for cooking and 
having other people be inspired by me to make a 
positive change. Just in the way we eat and just 
interact with food and promoting sustainability 
and all the important stuff like that.

Koiner: And I have one more fun question for you. If you 
had to only eat one dish for the rest of your 
life, what would that be? And why?

Marquez: I guess just like steak, street tacos. I don't 
know, hard choice to make.

Koiner: That's a good answer. Well, Max, I want to say 
thank you so much for taking the time to speak to 
me today. It was a pleasure to get to know you 
and learn more about your life and your passion 
for food. 

Marquez: Thank you
