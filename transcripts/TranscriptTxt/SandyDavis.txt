Brent Bardin: We can't see you yet. Perfect.
Sandy Davis: All right, how about that? OK. Yeah, good. How

Brent Bardin: Yeah, we're so excited. We get to interview -
-
Sandy Davis: Much sunshine back here.
Brent Bardin: Oh yeah, no, it looks great. We can see you. 
Great.
Sandy Davis: Okay, because I can move around the table.
Brent Bardin: Oh, no, you look great.
Sandy Davis: I mean, I'm in the dining room.
Brent Bardin: Perfect. Are you in Abilene?
Davis: Yeah, Yeah, yeah.
Bardin: Ohh, awesome. Are you seeing your mom?
Davis: She passed.
Bardin: Oh, she did? I'm sorry.
Davis: Yeah, she passed in March, March of '22. So, she's 
been gone. She's been gone two years.
Bardin: OK. Well, it's good to see you. Are you visiting my 
grandpa while you're there?
Davis: I haven't made a plan to do that. I'm here 3 weeks, 
so.
Bardin: Oh, that's awesome. He would love it.
Davis: I'm here because I'm more than likely going to sell 
this place, so.
Bardin: Yeah?
Davis: I don't know. I'm not, you know, of course, 
everybody's saying. Well, what? But this is a 
place that you could eventually go. And I was 
like, OK, you go to Abilene and live. I've done 
that. Not gonna do that again.
Bardin: Yeah, that's how I feel. I'm like, I don't need to 
go.
Davis: You are welcome to live in Abilene. All you want to. 
I don't want to.
Bardin: I get that it's hard. It's hard to go from New York 
City to Abilene.
Davis: Ohh yeah and the last because of my mother's health 
since 2011, I've done it many, many, many.
Bardin: So, you're probably retired.
Davis: And it's like flight. It's like flying from Venus to 
Mars.
Bardin: So, we have we have a couple of questions.
Davis: Let's see. OK, let me -- how do I get? Ohh. 
[unclear]
Bardin: Go. Perfect. So, we have some just about we're glad 
that you said yes because we had to interview 
someone that was like, interesting from the 
culinary world. And I have the perfect person. 
OK, good.
Bardin: But do you wanna do --? You wanna just alternate?
Gabriela Whitmore: Yeah.
Bardin: I can ask the 1st. One. OK. So, we're just curious 
like what drew you to like cooking in the 
culinary world originally?
Davis: Well, I always cooked growing up, and I spent a 
major portion of my time whenever we had family 
together. I was with my grandmother in the 
kitchen. All the rest of the cousins were outside 
throwing a ball and that bullshit. And you know, 
trying to hit it with a stick or something, ugly. 
So, I thought, no, I'm not going to do that. And 
what grandmother was doing was way more 
interesting to me. So, I learned early on about, 
you know, she was one of those instinctive, 
instinctive cooks. She never measured anything. 
She never had to have a recipe. You just had to 
tell her what you wanted, and she'd do it. She 
knew exactly what to do.
Bardin: OK. 
Davis: And on top of that, she had, in the depression -- 
the worst year of the depression, my mother was 
born, and she had already had four kids.
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: And she fed field hands every single day three times 
a day. And now you talk about a productive cook? 
You know that was something. And so, she was my 
example. I learned so much from her. But how 
about how did I get there professionally? I refer 
to myself as an accidental chef, primarily 
because I have a degree in English literature 
from Abilene Christian University. And if you're 
not going to go to law school, you better learn 
to do something fast, yes. And that's what I did. 
I went right into food. And I mean, I bopped 
around for a couple of years, but I ended up in 
food, and I ended up getting hired as a chef. And 
I never -- I was a chef, and I had -- and you 
talk about by the seat of your pants. 
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: It was, it was. But I was working for some really 
good people in Austin. Very fortunate the woman 
that hired me was the food critic. For Texas 
monthly.
Whitmore: Wow.
Davis: And so. But the -- we always approached it with just 
don't be insecure about not knowing. You don't 
know something -- I don't know how to do that. 
Mhm. And not be insecure about it. So that's kind 
of where that happened. And then it just grew. 
And then the next thing you know, I'm working 
with a guy from that was born and raised. In 
Lyon, France. And believe me, I watched every 
single move he made. Yeah. So, there you go.
Bardin: That's awesome. So, you start --
Davis: What?
Bardin: So you started cooking originally like in Texas, in 
Austin, was that your first?
Davis: In Austin.
Bardin: So.
Davis: Well, I catered friends weddings in college. You 
know, I did that in college, but when I got to 
Austin. I got hired but. Chopped up story I 
worked for the Sergeant of Arms office at the 
Texas House representatives in 1979. And I met a 
woman there named Helen Baxter, who was the food 
Critic for Texas monthly. And she did all the 
entertainer entertaining for Speaker Clayton at 
that time. And so, we did all the entertaining 
behind the scenes in the House of 
Representatives.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: And so with big displays and this and that and I 
just sort of picked it up, I never asked anybody, 
oh, how? Do I do this? I just sort of did it. 
[Unclear]
Bardin: That's awesome. Just like your grandma.
Davis: What?
Davis: Kind of, yeah. Kind of the same way, you know, she 
just. Yeah, she --
Bardin: That's awesome.
Davis: She lived by the adage that, and I'll quote her 
"Son, you can do anything you put your mind to," 
and that's why she lived her life and that that 
left an impression on me. So, I guess that's how 
I live mine so.
Bardin: That is awesome. I love that that's a good way to 
be.
Davis: So, but yeah, I'm an accidental chef. It just sort 
of all the conditions came together and there you 
go. And then by the time that I, in 1987 -- I 
bought a one way ticket to New York with -- and I 
was on the plane with my last unemployment check.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: Yeah. And I bought a one-way ticket. And it's 30-
some-odd years later, and here I'm still in. New 
York, so.
Bardin: That's more awesome.
Davis: Yeah, and that, that was the only thing I knew how 
to do. So, I went to work at an executive dining 
room on Wall Street. Prudential.
Bardin: Auburn, New York.
Davis: Yes, prudential based securities. On Water, that way 
down in the Financial. So yeah, and. From that I 
met people until I got my first apartment. I'm 
still in the same building. Yeah, just, you know, 
things just happen, so. So, yeah.
Bardin: That's so awesome. That's so cool.
Davis: So next.
Bardin: Perfect. We have quite a few, one of them, our 
professor. It might seem a little out of order 
because our professor just wants to --
Davis: That's all right.
Whitmore: So how do you see the future of food in North 
Texas or in just Texas or New York, even in 
general?
Davis: The future of food? Well, that's a tough one, you 
know. Four years ago, before the pandemic and 
before all this rampant inflation.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: I would have said the future of food is going to be 
farm to table. Really organic, groovy, groovy. 
Hippy. Dippy, but. Now I think people just want 
food they can afford.
Bardin: Yes, definitely.
Davis: And that's the future of food finding food you can 
afford. Yeah, I mean, it's just you know. People 
can stand there and say, oh, well, these are the 
best source ingredients and this is all non-GMO 
and this has not been sprayed with any kind of 
stuff or not any harm, and none of that.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: Well, that's great. Tell me, who can afford it?
Bardin: Yeah, exactly, you know.
Davis: And so, the future of food that's. Two level 
questions. If You've got a lot of money. Then the 
future of food is going to be all this organic, 
hippie-dippie -- the chicken that was massaged. 
And sent to a psychiatrist and all this crap. If 
you can't afford that, the whole goal is going to 
be, find food that you and your family can afford 
to eat.
Bardin: Yes, for sure. Yeah, it's hard right now we're in 
college. We just started buying groceries. And 
like it's it gets crazy right now.
Davis: Now.
Whitmore: Like --
Davis: Ohh, it's awful. It's just awful and I've been in 
New York. Luckily, I live near a little store 
called Western.
Bardin: Yeah, I understand, couponing and all that.
Davis: On West 16th St. between 9th and 10th Ave. and it is 
kind of the local ghetto place, for lack of a 
better term -- please don't quote me on that, for 
lack of a better term -- and I end up getting 
better deals there.
Bardin: Yes, for sure.
Davis: Than I do anywhere else, I mean. Stores along the 
major avenues like Steve's or. What is the one 
that's called it? That's. West side West side 
market, that kind of thing, it's.
Bardin: Mm-hmm.
Davis: All really bougie.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: And you know, and you just walk and I walk in and I 
look at those prices and I laugh and turn around, 
walk out. I just -- I will not. Primarily, 'cause 
I know what it costs wholesale.
Bardin: You know --
Davis: Ship cost from the farmer to the seller to think. 
And I know that somebody is screwing somebody 
bad.
Bardin: Because you, you know -- Yes, for sure.
Davis: So, I just, I just don't, I mean -- like the first. 
remember when the first Whole Foods opened in New 
York and I walked in the door, first thing I saw 
was 1/2 pint of raspberries, Driscoll. Famous 
brand and it was $3 more than anywhere else on 
the Ave.
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: And I thought. What? And I started laughing and I 
turned around and walked out. I didn't go look at 
the rest of the store. I get it, and sure enough, 
it wasn't a month until people were calling Whole 
Foods "Whole check."
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Because you have to spend your whole --
Bardin: Check.
Davis: When you went there so, so the future of food back 
to that question is going to be what we can 
afford to feed. I mean, there's, you know, 
there's all kinds of movements. When I, ten years 
ago, it was the scientific movement of food, you 
know, and all the different ways you can 
manipulate it and put an olive in it smokes out 
of your mouth and all this crap. And that looked 
like it was a very promising future.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: Achatz was one in Chicago. Ohh, who else? There was 
one here in Texas. But they were doing all this, 
this scientific experimental food. And I thought, 
OK, that will last until people can afford to 
eat, and then they're going to be looking for 
chickens.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: You know, so again it goes. I think it goes back.
Bardin: To --
Davis: A question of affordability.
Bardin: For sure.
Davis: So yeah.
Bardin: That that makes a lot of sense we that it's like 
crazy inflation is crazy right now, yeah.
Davis: It's awful. It's just. However, I do expect that to 
back down. Because I think the people will leave 
a lot of stuff on the shelves and it will rot. 
And once that happens, you can bet that price 
comes down. That's the way supply and demand 
works. So anyway. All right, what's -- what you 
got next?
Bardin: So, I was just curious, like, speaking about, like, 
inflation in, like, both Texas and New York, 
like, what's the difference between, like, the 
prices of New York and versus Texas and then the 
quality of the food in like Texas and New York, 
is it kind of the same?
Davis: OK, it is cheaper across the board. Cheaper across 
the board, one thing that separates -- now I'm 
speaking specifically of the five boroughs --
Bardin: Mm-hmm.
Davis: Of the city. I'm not speaking of upstate. I'm not, 
you know, upstate is a whole 'nother land. It's a 
whole another culture.
Bardin: Mm-hmm.
Davis: The city, however, uh, you know, we paid 3 levels of 
income tax. We pay city, state and federal.
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: And Texas has one federal. That's it. So, Texas is, 
I mean, in fact, it always takes me about four or 
five days when I go to the grocery store to look 
at the prices and go, OK, who made this? This is 
a mistake, this can't be right, you know, because 
I'm in New York, I pay $13 for a chicken, and 
here it's $6 for a chicken. So, you know it's a, 
it's a whole another. That's the difference. 
That's the primary difference, in Texas and New 
York -- Texas is much cheaper now. The quality is 
a multi-layered question. Because it totally 
depends on what you're after. Uh, for example, 
most of the produce departments in Texas and now 
I'm Speaking of things like Central Market of the 
whole HEB chain, most produce sections are -- 
they're prettier and fresher than the ones in New 
York. Because they don't have. Let's see, I'm 
trying to remember --
Bardin: Everything.
Davis: Because they don't. Are you there?
Whitmore: Yes. Yeah, still there.
Davis: Still there. Because they, uh -- it's in -- the 
produce in Texas is closer to the source. Yeah, 
for sure. And then, but then you flip that over 
and get out of the produce department and go to 
the meat department.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: And you would think, being in a cattle raising 
state, you're going to get a great brisket for 
not a lot of money. Uh, I -- think again, my 
friend, think again. In fact, the beef prices 
here in Abilene rival the beef prices in New 
York. 
Bardin: Wow, yeah. So that's not it's not really like.
Davis: There's not. You can't go. It's not. You can't go 
across the board with whatever you, for example, 
I say that about produce being prettier. Unless 
you're in Union Square farmers market in June, 
July, August, September, and October, you're 
never going to see more beautiful vegetables and 
fruits.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: Because they're grown right there. Peaches, corn, 
tomato, Jersey tomatoes. My God. You know, just 
it's just over the top. Delicious. It's -- You 
can't put food is not a monolith, you know it's 
it, you. You've got to break it up and say, OK 
what are you buying? So, you know. I mean, 
there's nothing better than Parker County 
Peaches, but that happens in June. And by August, 
they're all bad because of the heat -- ohh, we 
don't have that in New York, so. We have much we 
have a much longer summer. You know, in terms of 
and also it's still cold up there. So, we're 
still wearing sweaters and we'll wear sweaters 
until June the 1st.
Bardin: That's awesome. So it just it just depends on like 
the group and --
Davis: So yeah. Today, it's nice they're predicting not.
Bardin: Everything.
Davis: They're today, they're predicting 95 for Abilene, 
OK. It's April. Thank you.
Bardin: Oh my word Yeah.
Davis: Yeah. So I'm going to have. To close out here very 
soon and turn on the cooler which I regret. 
Anyway, OK, what's -- Yeah, you can't. These food 
questions are tricky in that you can't put food 
in one box. You've got to divide it up. What am I 
looking for? What am I buying? Am I vegetarian? 
Am I vegan? Am I?
Bardin: For sure.
Davis: So that's kind of how that all works.
Bardin: I get that. That's awesome. Thank you so much. 
Yeah.
Whitmore: Yeah. So how did you grow relationship with the 
cooking channel? That first.
Bardin: Or like the Food Network.
Davis: Oh, how did you find out about Chopped is that? One 
you're asking me? Yes.
Bardin: Yes, we're super interested.
Davis: OK, it was May of 2008.
Bardin: Pardon.
Davis: And I was as busy as a cranberry merchant. I did not 
know my name. I was so busy and a friend of mine 
from college who was a professor at Vanderbilt 
sent me a link and said this is perfect for you 
and that's all I saw. And I clicked on it and I 
realized it was an application for a food 
competition show. And I went ohh Terry I said 
thank you so much. And I cause number one. I 
don't believe cooking is something like a 
football game, and the competing and that's not 
what it's about, and sadly, that's what America 
thinks it is.
Bardin: Yes, for sure.
Davis: And it and they think that. Because of the food 
chain.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: And bravo and on and on and on. And all these guys 
that cuss and make the girls cry and blah, blah 
blah. It's not like that in a kitchen in New York 
City. It's not like that. And I, you know, it's 
been it's sort of being misrepresented. So I 
deleted it.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Hmm. Well, towards the end of the summer, I wasn't 
busy. And I was broke. So I went to Craigslist 
looking for catering work. Freelance chef work 
and. I got about, I don't know, five or six days 
in and there was that post and I clicked it and I 
went, wait a minute. I've seen this and I 
thought, OK, two times is I'll do it. So, I'd had 
a couple of drinks and it was Sunday Night around 
10 o'clock and I filled out all the papers and I 
sent a picture of me in a chefs coat with a glass 
of champagne and a flower over 1 ear -- And I 
sent them the picture. I pressed send at midnight 
at 10:00, my phone blew.
Bardin: Up.
Davis: The next morning, who are you? Where are you? What 
do you do? We've got to film you, blah, blah, 
blah, blah. And so, they came to where I was, my 
kitchen, which was at Union Theological Seminary 
at the time. Which is part of Columbia, the 
Columbia system. And they shot me, you know. And 
of course, what? This was a brand-new show. They 
had only done a pilot and on the strength of that 
pilot, they said, OK, we'll take two years, but 
we get final judgment on everybody.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: So. Ohh, they have to film everybody, every 
contestant. What they do, what is called a sizzle 
reel.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: And they do it. And then they edit it down and it 
goes up the chain. All the way to the director of 
programming because they want to be sure that 
they're not hiring a psycho, that the guys not 
going to drool on camera. You know this happened. 
So yeah, I mean it's pretty basic when you think 
about it and so.
Bardin: Uh-huh.
Davis: I got the OK and it was a series of green lights. 
And the next thing you know, I'm at 6:30 in the 
morning at Union Square and they picked me up in 
a van.
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: And we head off to the Wilds of Queens. I have no 
idea where that studio was. I could not find that 
to this day. And off we went. And I didn't leave 
until 3:30 in the morning. The next morning.
Bardin: Why?
Davis: Because it they had just started shooting so they 
didn't know what they were doing. So they would 
come out in some set tech would come out and move 
the tape and say now stand over there, OK. And 
then come back. Move it again. Now stand over 
here. And so this went on all day long.
Bardin: Mm.
Davis: And so it just, you know, like for example. I'm kind 
of think of things like once they start OK on the 
finished product, once they start the clock it 
doesn't stop, but that's not how it works when 
they're shooting it.
Whitmore: Really?
Davis: I got my basket and they started the clock and I 
opened it and I laughed and they said cut. Sandy, 
we want you to open your basket and laugh and 
they got me to do it four more times.
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: So, they could use the best laugh, see what I mean 
so.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: Here's what I -- Would say about all of that and 
food television and this is this is you can sort 
of. Encapsulate it this way.
Bardin: OK.
Davis: The people that are making those shows do not give a 
shit about the food. It is all about living and 
all about eyeballs watching the screen. It is not 
about the food is simply the sideshow.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: That's kind of, like the carnival hawker out front 
that get you to come in to see the fat lady. You 
know, or whatever it is like that they're 
Hawking. So it's all about television. It's all 
about food. It's a mistake. People mistakenly 
think, oh, but didn't you? What about this? 
Taking that piece of pork and this and that? No, 
it's not. That does not matter. And also when 
they're looking for personalities on the Food 
Network, it does not matter if you win or not, 
they don't care. It's how you read on camera.
Bardin: For sure.
Davis: You know that that's what that whole thing is about, 
so. What was the original? What did you --? I 
think I got off track here.
Bardin: No, you honestly, we had a lot of questions about 
Chopped, that's we're really interested.
Davis: Oh, OK, all right.
Bardin: In that, so we just asked, like, how did you, like, 
grow your relationship with the Food Network? But 
I think we understand that now, like.
Davis: Well, I'll tell you. Exactly what happened on that. 
They were after me and they were contacting me 
and they were telling me that I was the next big 
thing. And that they were gonna -- They've got a 
lot of ideas for me and Bobby Boop. Boop got 
invited to some parties, blah, blah, blah, where 
all the judges would come up to me and go. You're 
our favorite contestant. Why are you here? And 
so, yeah. And I was like, because they asked me. 
Uh anyway they. I was. I was the next big thing 
until I wasn't. And then all of a sudden, no more 
phone calls. No more, nothing was not going to 
spend valuable time pursuing those people. I was 
not going to go looking. I'm the talent. And I 
did very well for you guys. I was the first 
chopped champion on television. I was the 
premiere episode. I opened up a successful 
franchise y'all want me on TV? Come get me. Yeah, 
I'm right.
Bardin: Yes, that's awesome.
Davis: Here you got phone number, baby. So I just. I 
dropped the whole thing I just said, you know 
what? I. No. No, no, no, no. That's not how. This 
is going to play out.
Bardin: For sure it's really like a pickle.
Davis: So that was what laugh was. I was the next big thing 
until I wasn't. And it happened almost that 
quickly.
Bardin: Yeah. Wow. So.
Davis: And I developed a -- I developed a distaste for 
people in the television industry across the 
board. How's that for a generalization?
Bardin: That's so -- that's so interesting though. It's 
like, it's so cool to hear, like, the behind the 
scenes. Like, it's not. It's not everything. You 
think it is like on the screen like it's a lot 
more work.
Davis: And they're and they the producers phone it all the 
anxiety and they you know they're talking it up. 
Backstage. Mm-hmm. Now there's only 3 pounds of 
butter out there.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: You need butter. You be sure to get over there and 
don't you let that other person out there have 
it.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: I'm like, what are you? Who's gonna use a pound of 
butter? Are you stupid? You know I just. You 
know, just that whole. You know, there's a whole. 
There's a whole level of TV people that deal with 
that, that are called reality producers. And in 
1970, 80, 90 -- they did not exist.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: They exist now in multiple versions and they make a 
lot of money. So that's one reason they keep 
doing what? They're doing so because people watch 
it. Anyway, so there you go. Although I was in 
all fairness, reality TV has taken sort of a 
dive.
Bardin: That's it.
Davis: People are tired of that. You know, cussing in the 
kitchen and the Bachelor and the what is that 
woman going to get a divorce and --
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: They're just tired of it and nobody wants to do 
that, so, anyway.
Bardin: For sure. Well, thank you so much for your answer. 
That was so interesting. We -- me and Gabby and I 
were so interested in that.
Whitmore: I love Chopped. I grew up watching Chopped, like 
every weekend with my dad. So.
Davis: Well, I think I think what made Chopped such an 
attractive show. Was It set up a problem and 
resolved it in 44 minutes. And you didn't have 
to. Oh, what happened last week? I'm going to be 
behind. You know, it was not serial television. 
It was episodic television.
Bardin: It's super easy.
Davis: Meaning it was all everything was decided in.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: And that's people, about 40. If you can get 44 
minutes of an Americans undivided attention, 
you've done something.
Bardin: That's so true.
Davis: Because we are definitely the ADHD people of the 
world. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Anyway.
Bardin: So.
Davis: One of the questions was -- What about? How did I 
get to New York?
Bardin: Yeah. So yeah, we were. We were just curious like 
so was it you said like was it a catering 
opportunity that brought you to New York?
Davis: No, no, no, no.
Bardin: Was it just you just wanted to go?
Davis: I when I was 8 years old, I got bit by the bug. I 
would watch -- Ohh in fact. Times did a huge 
piece on this.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: And it was called did you get the? New York bug? and 
it was amazing piece.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: And the truth is I did it. At eight years old in 
1962, three. I would wait for my parents went to 
bed. And I would close all the doors and I would 
get right in front of this zenith with a green 
glass. Yeah. And the tube was kind of almost 
round and I would watch Johnny Carson in black 
and white. And I would see guests like Truman 
Capote. Well, Johnny, you know. To one side and I 
think.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Where is this magical place? Yes. That men can talk 
about books and ideas, and they're not talking 
about guns, cotton, oil, and football. Where can 
I go? Where is this magic place? And it took me 
till I was 33 to get there, but I did and I 
always knew I would.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: Because I got bit, I mean. I remember that he had 
Elaine, a very young Elaine Stritch. Drunk as a 
skunk on national TV. And they shot it. They shot 
it that afternoon and they aired it. I mean, they 
said, oh, well, that's just Elaine. Nobody 
thought anything about that.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: OK, so she's had. A couple of drinks. So what? 
Because everybody else had had a couple of drinks 
too.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: You know, there wasn't there. Wasn't all this stuff. 
That you have to wade through and all you know 
all this stuff so that that was what happened. I 
got bit. And in 1970, mother was coming to 
Abilene. I lived way out in the country. Boca, 
Texas. There were 15 in my graduating class, by 
the way.
Whitmore: Oh wow.
Davis: And. In 1970, I was a sophomore, and she was coming 
to Abilene and I said would you please? There was 
one. Newsstand in downtown that would I'll never 
forget was run by a blind man. And there was 1 
newsstand that carried The New Yorker for sale. 
And this was like, you may as well brought 
somebody a moon rock. You know, it was so rare.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: And mother brought me. I still have it. Mother 
brought me in in 1970. And the cover was Lauren 
McCall, and she was in Applause. Which wiped out 
the Tonys. I got that magazine and I memorized 
that thing from cover to cover. I knew every word 
I got and I went through all the little ads, 
everything I could get my hands on about New 
York. I was desperate for information about New 
York.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: And then of course, got to college and found a lot 
of likeminded friends in Abilene, Texas. You know 
one, in fact one of them. Whose dad was the vice 
president?
Bardin: Oh wow.
Davis: Two of them Bob Hunter, Kent Hunter, was the son and 
he and I are still friends. He lives in 
Connecticut. I go up there all the time.
Bardin: That's awesome.
Davis: Yeah, we're still buddies. He and they, they knew 2 
alumni of Abilene Christian, a man named Darrell 
Osborne. And a woman named Twyla, Duncan, Twyla 
Duncan, and I talked just this morning. Kent he? 
Bob, Told Kent that for his graduation from high 
school present he would give him a weeklong trip 
in New York.
Bardin: Oh wow.
Davis: And Bob had called all the alumnus. In New York and 
Kent got to see such things as get this. The 
original Chicago, with Cheetah Rivera. Yeah, so 
jealous. And watch them.
Bardin: Oh my gosh, I have such.
Whitmore: I have tears in my eyes oh.
Davis: God, he they took him to on the Upper East Side. 
Used to be called Germantown.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: And Darrell took him to an [unclear], you know, 
oompah band puts that serve Schnitzel and beer. 
Thought that would be done. And it was. You had 
to go downstairs to this place. And Kent was just 
sitting. There and he just had gotten his food. 
And looked up. And who was walking down the 
staircase? Dragging a mink coat. Gloria Swanson.
Bardin: Ohh my word.
Davis: Yes.
Davis: I mean, he saw everything in that one trip, and when 
he got back that summer, I had never been as 
jealous of anybody in my life. I wouldn't talk to 
him.
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: I was so mad. I just said you little shit. And he 
was younger than me. So, I could call him that, 
see. But anyway. That's just part of the New York 
saga. I mean, the truth is, is that when you live 
there every day. I mean you. You can get into 
those situations every single day because that's 
what it's about.
Bardin: I'm so jealous. I want to go back so bad.
Davis: Do I when I tell me, will you?
Bardin: I would love to live there.
Davis: You were you, one of the grandsons that got the bed 
or the couch? 
Bardin: I got the bed? I was older, so I got the bed. I was 
very lucky.
Davis: OK, alright, alright. Well you. I came in. Well, I 
got back in my bed. Pad was slid off to the side. 
I thought this this guy, this guy must have been 
having the worst.
Bardin: Ohh what? Right. Well, I'm so sorry.
Davis: Either that you found. Somebody that you were having 
fun with and y'all got in a fight or something.
Bardin: I wish so and I was like.
Davis: You got this. I mean the it had never done that it 
was it was.
Bardin: Wow, I'm sorry.
Davis: No, it wasn't. It was not a big deal off to the 
side. My God. What did they? Do in here.
Bardin: I got the fight with my grandpa.
Davis: It was fun. Oh, yeah, I know it. Yeah. That was that 
conversation was so funny because the minute I 
got up, he called me and I picked up. And the 
minute I got his.
Bardin: Hello.
Davis: That I heard. His voice. I knew something was up and 
he goes well. We're coming to New York on the 
27th. And I we would love to take you to Dinner. 
And I said I'd love that, except I'm landing in 
Abilene on the 25th. Yes. And then we just. There 
were some niceties and I said well, next time 
blah blah. And I said Andy, would you like to say 
here you didn't miss a beat? Yes. And I knew 
right then. That he had been looking at.
Bardin: Hotel prices? Yes, for sure. Oh, yeah. My apartment 
is not New York fabulous by any means. No, it is. 
I've loved it. We have the best time ever.
Davis: Yes. But when you could. But when? But when you 
consider the price, it becomes the Waldorf 
Astoria.
Bardin: Oh yeah.
Davis: For your very eye.
Bardin: Yeah. Well, there's.
Davis: Yes.
Bardin: Yes, there's these videos on TikTok that I've gone 
viral, where it's like people show off their New 
York apartment and there are so many that 
literally like the tiniest like 1 little closet. 
So it's like yours was so great. We had the best 
time.
Davis: I'm very, very, very lucky. Very lucky.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: I can, I can assure you that I would not be living 
in New York City if it weren't for rent 
stabilization. Thank God for blue states, thank 
God.
Bardin: Yes, for sure.
Davis: All I can say.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: I would not be there if. It wasn't, I mean. That 
apartment. What I'm paying you is not is not 
cheap by. Texas standards, but it's less than 
half by New York standard. That apartment would 
probably they probably could get 5000 for that. 
And I can assure you I don't. Pay that. So yeah, 
so.
Bardin: And it's in such a good it's in such a good 
neighborhood. It's so awesome.
Davis: Well, yeah, see, that wasn't that way when I got the 
in fact. When I moved into the belly. OK, I 
worked with this. Guy named George Carlin. As God 
is my judge, that was his name. And yeah. And I 
walked into work one morning, not long after. I 
had worked there like six months and I said I am 
going to have an apartment in this city or I'm 
going back to Texas.
Bardin: Ah.
Davis: Period.
Davis: And George goes. Well, Nick and I put a bid on a 
condo yesterday afternoon and you can come in. 
You can have ours. It's in. The stabilized 
building and I went.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: My mouth has dropped.
Davis: I'll never forget my first rent for a one bedroom 
$684.13 I'll never forget that number.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: But I got their I got their apartment. And they sold 
me all their stuff and I paid. My mother sent me 
the money to pay for it, and I had to send it. I.
00:39:03 Bardin: Oh wow.
Davis: Had to send it back to her. But that's I. Wouldn't 
be there if it wasn't for rent stabilization, so.
Bardin: Anyway, so awesome. Well, thank you so much for 
letting us dig in. It was so great.
Davis: We yeah, but we haven't. You got there's a bunch 
more. Questions on there.
Bardin: Ohh yeah, we do. We have a lot. Let me ask you. Who 
in the flying Fudge told you that?
Davis: New York was. A food desert. Where in the hell did 
you get that tonight?
Whitmore: OK, I've only heard that in terms of like finding 
like grocery stores and stuff like that.
Davis: Could not be more untrue.
Whitmore: OK.
Davis: Could not be more untrue. There are three food 
cities in the United States. Do you want to guess 
it what they are?
Whitmore: OK. Well, New York, I'm guessing.
Bardin: New York, yes, LA.
Davis: No.
Bardin: Chicago.
Davis: San Francisco and New Orleans and New York. Those 
are the three that are considered the highest 
developed food. Cities in the world. Of all the 
cuisines in the entire world, you can eat them in 
the five boroughs, all of them, every single one. 
Every tribe in Africa.
Whitmore: Yes.
Bardin: Yes. Mm-hmm. For sure.
Davis: Every, every Russian, any anything. Davis You want 
is right there. Yeah, that's awesome. Now grocery 
stores, that's a whole 'nother kettle of fish as 
we spoke.
Davis: It. I am lucky that I have this. Little grocery 
store near me. But the but the produce has to 
travel so far to get to New York. First of all, 
we have a lot from California just like you do 
here in Hampton. And it has to travel well. It 
only has to travel 1600 miles to get to about 
1500 miles. Then it has to travel another 1600 to 
get to New York. So, by the time it gets there, 
it's taking a beating.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: The time when New York's produce is the best -- it's 
in the summer and we grow it on the East Coast.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: Peaches, corn, tomatoes, squash, plums. Just 
amazing, amazing, amazing stuff, but a head of 
lettuce, that lettuce is going to come from 
California. No matter you can. Stop your feet and 
cry. And scream about a carbon footprint and that 
lettuce is coming from California, by God. So it 
doesn't matter you know it, it would be great. We 
could grow lettuce. Locally in New York, but we 
can't. So if you get a salad in the middle of 
winter. It came from California.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: And so that that's one of the big drawbacks. Hmm. 
But there's all the specialty stores that we. 
Have that have been there forever and ever. And 
they were all Italian immigrants. Green growth 
the you know up and down the avenues. Green 
grocers go to the greengrocer and get. Davis: 
Well, they became powerful families too. The 
Balducci's, the D'Agostino's, the Gristede's, the 
Citarella's. And to this day, they are the finest 
stores in New York, especially Citarella. 
Citarella is my favorite place on the planet 
well. I like that he's no longer in business 
except one of the sisters got pissed off and her 
brothers weren't treating her nicely. And they 
were treating her like a woman. They treated 
women in those days and Grace just said screw 
y'all and went to the Upper East Side on 72nd St. 
and started Grace's marketplace. Her name was 
Grace Balducci. And she started Grace's 
marketplace and made a trainload of money. 
Because the Upper East Side was dying for 
somebody like her. And she, Grace's marketplace. 
And then she decided to start home goods. So, she 
started Grace's Home, which again made so much 
money. And she had little ladies on the Upper 
East Side wrapped around her finger. Yeah. And 
like, were the ones with money.
Bardin: That's awesome.
Davis: You know anyway, so, but I could go on and on about. 
That, but that has little. To do with what you're 
doing, OK?
Bardin: We think it's so interesting. We love just hearing 
you talk is so awesome. So we had a couple of 
questions like just about like your cooking style 
that you implement like daily, so like what 
styles of cooking like do you draw from?
Davis: Well, you know, there are methods that are the same 
across the board. In fact, there are 13. As you 
probably know, there are 13 cooking methods.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: And that is stuff like deep frying, skillet frying, 
steaming, boiling. Braising I don't. In fact, I 
taught the class. And I couldn't tell you what 
they are. I don't because you know what, as 
you're doing it, you don't. You're not going to 
stand there and go well let me look at the 
textbook. No. Yes, you do it. And so, but they're 
-- Well, for example, I noticed in there you 
asked about Texas food. Do I use that? Well in 
Texas food is an amalgam of several different 
kinds. You had the Indians, which had the three 
sisters. Do you know what the three sisters are? 
Beans, corn and squash.
Bardin: Oh yeah, of course I.
Davis: OK. Yeah, that they had the three sisters. So that's 
where we get. Cornbread. And that's where we get 
squash and that's where we get big Pop's Pinto 
beans. All that, that's not just Texas, it's when 
it's what happens when different influences 
cultural influences come together.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: For example, chicken fried steak. If you were going 
to guess what nationality chicken fried steak 
guess what would you say?
Bardin: Ohh that's a good one. I would say like German.
Whitmore: Yeah, because that's kind of.
Davis: Really. Yeah. And it? Yeah. It's on the nose. And 
Texans, this grew out of the whole Schnitzel of 
frying Schnitzel. They throw fried pork. They 
fried deer. They fried meat. They fried chicken. 
That's also where fried chicken came from.
Bardin: Yeah. Oh wow.
Davis: From the Germans and half bread with eggs and 
seasonings and so forth. That's all very German. 
Northern European. It's also very Italian. So you 
had all kinds of influences.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: You always have to remember that every state in our 
union is a bunch of mutt puppies. We're not 
thoroughbreds. To a stretch neither is our food. 
So you have all these cultural influences that 
come together, the best example of that is New 
Orleans, French, slave, and Creole.
Bardin: Umm for sure. Yep.
Davis: And they all came together. In fact, the word gumbo 
comes from the African word for Okra "ki ngombo."
Bardin: Ohh wow.
Davis: And yeah, and the okra came over on slave boats to 
the Caribbean and then up to New Orleans. And the 
creoles were a whole different other group of 
people. And they had indigo plantations, but they 
also had their own kind of food. And it was 
spicy. And then there was the French. And then if 
you put all that in. A pot and stir it up. You 
get what, Cajun? And Cajun, you know, the Cajuns 
came from the mouth of Saint Lawrence River. And 
they came all they -- I Love this story They were 
at the Saint Lawrence River and the English ran 
them off.
Bardin: Uh-huh.
Davis: They were. They were French Protestants and the, the 
English ran them all because they didn't want the 
French. They England hated France as always and 
they so they sailed all the way down. Around the 
coast of Florida and landed at the. Mouth of the 
Mississippi River and that was they were called 
and that area around the Saint Lawrence was 
Acadia. Yeah. Well, if you corrupt that word to 
Cadia and then to Cajun, that's where the word 
came from.
Davis: And so, it comes all the way around. To New Orleans. 
And the lobsters up in Maine and Saint Lawrence 
River were so sad to see the Cajuns go. That they 
followed them underwater all the way to 
Louisiana, and they were they by the and by the 
time they got, by the time they --
Whitmore: Wow.
Davis: Got to New Orleans. They were so small they became 
crawfish, and they backed up in the mud and 
that's where they come from, of course, a 
complete fairy tale. But it had a sweet story. 
Yes, it's just such a sweet story. I mean, it's 
almost like. It's almost like reading Evangeline 
or something you. Know that, yeah. But the 
English mistreated the French in in that part of 
Canada very badly. They sold their children. They 
killed all the kids.
Bardin: Uh-huh.
Davis: And but that -- that's how you, but --- That 
wherever people move their food goes with them.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: Always
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: And so, you know, we have this and that and this and 
that I mean. Ask me another question. I think 
I've exhausted this one.
Bardin: No, that was really we talked about in our in our 
class like food is it called food culture. Oh 
yeah, I think. It's called food culture, where 
it's like, just like people. There's no really, 
like, our teacher talks about like, there's no 
really like authentic food because food gets 
changed or every culture and every person that, 
like cooks it, it's like different. So it's 
really.
Davis: Your teacher is correct. The only the only thing I 
would argue with.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: Is that if you go up into the frozen regions they 
are eating the way they ate 2000 years ago.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: They're eating whale blubber and they're still 
Spearing fish and they're, you know.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: I mean. There are places where it remains unchanged. 
There are lots of tribes in Brazil who are they 
even have a name in Portuguese. For people that 
have that don't have contact with the outside 
world and they've been eating the same forever 
and ever and ever and ever.
Bardin: That's for sure. Yeah.
Davis: But no, it changes it the very nature of cooking is 
evolution. That's the very nature of it is to 
evolve and either get better or worse at. What 
you do
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: Some would argue that it's gotten worse. I would 
argue that it's gotten better. That cooking 
techniques have gotten better. That knowledge of 
techniques and also it helps when you study other 
cultures, not just yours, you know that I had 
five classes here in Abilene at Texas State 
Technical College.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Which is TSTC and it also stands for Too Stoned To 
Care. But I had the hardest time getting these 
kids to come out of their shell and. If once I 
said it 10,000 times, I would look at my student 
and I'd say, you know, there's a world outside of 
Abilene. Did you know that? It's big and it's 
beautiful. It's got all. Different stuff in it 
and they would look at. Me like I was speaking 
Greek. I mean, right? They had no clue. What I 
was saying to them. And by the end of that we 
were together there, I could barely see a flicker 
of the. Light turning on. Some of them. You know, 
just like in any other class, about 25% are 
really good. The middle 50 are average and the 
bottoms are losers. It's just like any other 
class in the world. Well, there was always the 
top 25% and they got it.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: From day one they got it. And but it was that middle 
group. Well, I don't really like fish. Well, then 
you shouldn't be a chef.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: You're you. You tell me that here in a class you are 
wasting your money. Stop now. You know, you just 
can't. That you cannot approach food that way.
Bardin: Yes.
Whitmore: Yeah.
Davis: So and I said on top of that and you as a chef in 
the kitchen, whether you like fish or not, no, 
nobody cares. Nobody cares. They want to go into 
a restaurant and know that you know how to make a 
nice filet of salmon.
Bardin: Yeah. Yes, for sure.
Davis: Or a filet of halibut. Or that you know how to. Like 
linguine clam sauce, they. Don't care that you 
personally don't eat this. They don't care.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: But they- what they do care about is that you know 
enough to make good food. And if you can't pull 
that off because of your dislike of seafood, stop 
now. Stop now.
Bardin: Uh, for sure. Yeah, for sure.
Davis: Don't spend any more money. Now it's my turn. What? 
What is this class? What is this you're doing? I 
-- I'm not clear on what it is.
Bardin: So it's. Is it's for our Latin American food 
history class and we just had to interview 
someone that was in, like, the culinary industry. 
That was really interesting.
Davis: OK, but this this, this class is part of what 
curriculum?
Bardin: It's a history course.
Davis: A history course.
Whitmore: Yes.
Davis: That well.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: That's wonderful because I think. The history of 
food in many ways, is the history of the Western 
Hemisphere, yes, for sure. Oh, in the Eastern 
hemisphere too, for that matter.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: It's -- food and religion have dominated more of 
those topics, yes. And if you go, if you do, if 
you were to do a broad survey.
Bardin: For sure.
Davis: Food and religion you're going to. Find coming to 
the top all the time.
Bardin: For sure.
Davis: And sadly, we haven't learned enough that religion 
is still killing people by the thousands every 
day. I mean, I sometimes wonder if we've evolved 
as a species at all.
Bardin: Yes, yeah, for sure.
Whitmore: Yep.
Davis: But that's neither here nor there. Latin American. 
You know, the company that I work for when I 
work, I don't work. Much anymore, but when I 
work. I just in fact 2 days ago. The company that 
I work for is called ROXO Events ROXO and that is 
my owners, mothers, maiden name and except that 
it's Portuguese and the way you say that in 
Portuguese is.
Bardin: Oh.
Davis: Hosho. So because R is an H and Portuguese. And so 
and it that so the. Whole company is Brazilian. 
And. Again, I've asked them 1000 questions about 
food in Brazil.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: It's the same thing. You've got the southern part, 
which is primarily blonde, blue eyed Germans, and 
I'd say that after World War 2 you really don't 
wanna ask them why they're there. You do? Yeah, I 
say so. So. So when you get together at 
Christmas, you don't really talk about your 
grandparents much, right? They go. Oh, no, we no, 
that's no. I know why they were there. They were 
on the run.
Whitmore: Yeah.
Davis: Know why they're there so. And of course one of my 
dear friends is named Luis Fernando Brixner.
Bardin: Oh wow.
Davis: Now that how's that for a clash of cultures? And 
he's blonde blue eyed and he's lived in the South 
of Brazil, the whole time well.
Bardin: Ah.
Davis: They have. They have a lot. Of the same influences 
here in Texas, the fried meats, the Schnitzel. 
But then the whole country that one of. The 
national dishes of Brazil is called feijoada.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: You know, have you studied that?
Bardin: I don't think so. Yeah.
Davis: You haven't. OK, well, it was brought by the once 
again the slaves. Dear old slaves brought up this 
dish with them to Brazil. But then they met. 
Whenever a culture comes into a country, it has 
to deal with what is being grown and hunted. So, 
if you don't have black beans in Africa. Guess 
what? You take the same ingredients and add black 
beans and. You make a pot of it, beans, and it -- 
and they -- and they say, well we got this idea 
in Africa.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Yeah, you didn't get black beans in Africa like so. 
It's always a big multi mesh pot -- mesh.
Bardin: Yes, for sure.
Davis: But the slaves brought this and it's got pig ears.
Bardin: Mhm.
Davis: And a Brazilian sausage named linguica. Mm-hmm. And 
black beans and it's considered a main dish which 
is a pot of rice, and I'm going to tell you it is 
delicious. Really. Really delicious. Yeah, in 
fact.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: For those for you students who are so cost 
conscious, I highly advise going looking up - 
feijoada, fej -- I think it's feijoada, or 
something like that. OK, if you put it in Google 
and go fej, it'll pop up.
Bardin: OK.
Davis: And try to find the ingredients -- I mean, of course 
I tried one time, and try to.
Bardin: OK.
Davis: Find a pig ear.
Bardin: That.
Davis: Yeah. Thank you.
Whitmore: No, those are difficult.
Davis: So I did not find the pig ears, so I use bacon. And 
I didn't find linguica, so I because I didn't 
find linguica, so I used Mexican chorizo.
Bardin: Found that. Yeah.
Davis: So that again, that's how food grows. You don't have 
any breeding, you approximate.
Bardin: That's awesome. Yeah.
Davis: And so we found. I made this beautiful pot of black 
beans, and I told my -- a couple of Brazilian 
friends of mine that it was feijoada and they 
came over and they stuck a spoon in and they 
looked at me like you've lost your mind. And I 
said, look. I know, I know, I know. But I wasn't 
gonna spend 10 hours going around New York trying 
to find all the stupid things.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: And now it's something small, like, oh, the market 
in -- And I said yeah, you live in Little Brazil 
I'm not going to go out there. No, no, I'm not 
going to get on the train.
Bardin: OK.
Davis: And go to Queens for. A pig ear. No, no, no.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: So, but we ended up having an incredibly good meal. 
It wasn't the feijoada that they knew as growing 
up, but we ate.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: It, nonetheless, yeah.
Bardin: That's so cool, because that's like a way that's a 
perfect example of, like, food culture. It's like 
you can make a dish without every aspect of a 
certain dish, and it, like, combines the 
cultures. And all that stuff that's really cool.
Davis: For lack, yes, that is the cool part. That is the 
very cool part. And. But what I would say to you 
about Latin American food is there's one word you 
need to pay attention to in every situation.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: Colonialism. They took over the world. The reason 
that Brazil speaks Portuguese is both because 
these Portuguese took over and they have. They 
eat a dish to this day, that's cod. And they soak 
it for two days and then layer it with potatoes 
and capers and tomatoes and onions and bake it. 
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton. 
This stuff is so. Good. You just can't believe 
how good this is. And it's called a -- What do 
they call? Oh, Bacalhau. That's what. That's what 
they call a cod so. Once again, just like New 
Orlans.
you've got the Portuguese, which are the colonialists, and 
they brought the slaves which brought the 
feijoada. And then you got the Germans down at 
the bottom, man. So you've got all this going on.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: Then you have these indigenous tribes that have. 
Never met anybody outside of the jungle. So 
they're eating the same way they ate. So you've 
got.
Bardin: Yeah, for sure.
Davis: This incredibly beautiful rich food culture. You 
know, yeah.
Bardin: I love it so interesting.
Davis: Well. And in fact, almost every country South of the 
Rio Grande River, you can say the same thing 
about yes. So because the colonialism matters it. 
I mean, we live with it. We live with it to this 
day. And not just in food, but in politics, in 
education and all kinds of things. We still live 
with the effects of colonialism.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: That's how okra, you know, Okra got to New Orleans 
and sweet potatoes and yams got to the South.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: On the slave ships. 
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: So anyway.
Bardin: It's interesting. It's like it's interesting, like.
Davis: Yeah. Look, look, look, look no further than the 
people that colonized you and that's where you're 
going to find the strongest. Culinary influences.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: So.
Bardin: Well, that's interesting. Thank you. We're running 
good on time. So we don't want to keep you too 
long, but thank you so much.
Davis: I know I listen. I'm. Are you kidding? It's a Sunday 
afternoon. What else am I going to be doing?
Bardin: That's how we feel. We're like we just.
Davis: Want to talk? No. Yeah, no, no.
Bardin: Right.
Davis: No, there's nothing.
Bardin: Well, we, we. Have a couple more questions if you 
have. Yeah, we have two more.
Davis: That's right.
Bardin: So we're just curious like just overall like 
throughout like your culinary like journey like 
what's been your favorite dish to cook and why is 
it your favorite?
Davis: You know, everybody has chefs there. Yes, everybody. 
There are two -- there are two questions that I -
- the most annoying questions in.
Bardin: Oh, are those two?
Davis: Those are, what's your specialty? And it's assumed 
that we have to have one. And I always answer 
with, well, I want to make everything I make 
delicious. So, there is nothing special about it. 
I want everything I make to be good.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: And so that kind of deflates them because they want 
you to say and they want it to have a name, you 
know, like Auguste Escoffier, who was.
Bardin: Bye.
Davis: A real womanizer. He names -- for all his dishes. 
No, peach melba.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: Well, Melba, with somebody you probably slept with. 
Yeah, you know, I mean, it's just that's common. 
It was kind of common. Knowledge at the time. He 
was a real and then he hooked up with that guy 
named Ritz and they were a pair man.
Bardin: OK.
Davis: They tore through London and Paris and made lots of 
money. And screwed lots of women. So anyway. 
That's kind of off the thing. Uh, but uh. Well, 
tell me. Say it again. Say it.
Bardin: Again, so we were just curious, like, what's your 
favorite?
Davis: Oh, the special. And the other thing that we hate is 
after you've been on your feet 15 hours, standing 
at a buffet.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: And somebody walks up and says, is it good? And you 
want to go no. I my feet are killing me right now 
and I did it just so I could make shitty food. 
That's. That's it. I did. Yeah. No, don't. And 
then of course they come up and then the third 
one that just drives you nuts, is it spicy? And 
you want to go? Yeah. And so now I've got to 
where I avoid it all together. I lie like a dog. 
I used to have this cute answer.
Bardin: Ah.
Davis: That I said, well, it has a. Bit of a kick, but 
nothing uncomfortable.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Now that's for diplomacy, so, but now I don't 
bother. I say yes, it's spicy. Don't eat it.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: Go to the next thing. Yeah, just don't eat it. Be 
better if you don't eat it. And you say something 
like -- then they'll say -- and then of course 
lately, it's the gluten. What?
Bardin: Does this have?
Davis: And even if I know it doesn't, I say yes it does. 
Yeah, I don't want the trouble. I don't want the 
trouble, you know? And some lady comes up. Goes, 
does this have gluten? I'll end up in the 
hospital and I go. OK, then don't eat anything 
that's on this buffet. You should have brought 
your own.
Bardin: Yeah. For sure.
Davis: Brought your own food. I'm not going to be held 
responsible for somebody's health. I'm sorry. No, 
no.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: So. You asked me. It was a pinch. OK, my, my, you 
asked what my favorite is. I will tell you what I 
like to cook and eat.
Bardin: Ah.
Davis: I love to cook and eat duck.
Bardin: Hmm.
Davis: And I love to cook and eat beautiful fillets of 
fish.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: Those two, those are two of my favorites. It used to 
be lamb, but the way they're the little babies 
are treated. It's real hard for me. To do that.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: I served lamb. Rack of lamb. Matter of fact, real 
high in dinner and it was at the whole time. I 
was thinking of the way they're treated. And 
they're little babies.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: Anyway, so I used to but, but it's still delicious 
and I still ate some of it because it's so 
*******. Excuse me -- because it's so delicious.
Bardin: Uh-huh. For sure.
Davis: Yeah, but I love but. But you know, you can say 
that. I mean, I love ducks as animals. I think 
they're darling animals. They really are. They 
love to be. Loved, they love, they're domestic. 
But I love to eat them. God Almighty, I love to 
eat them. So delicious.
Bardin: They're too good. We went when we were in New York 
over the winter break. We got, like, duck in 
Chinatown, like the one that like. They oh, 
hanging in the window. Duck. Yeah, it was so 
good.
Davis: Peking duck. Yeah, you know.
Bardin: It was so good.
Davis: Right after I moved to New York. There was a big to 
do.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: And the health department. Decided that it was going 
to enforce. All the laws. And it was going to go 
by the book.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: And they started popping restaurants. That had ducks 
hanging in the window, weren't refrigerated, and 
so 2 duck 2 duck, two Chinese City Council 
people.
Bardin: Wow.
Davis: Went to the city to the mayor's office and. Said, 
you know, my people have been eating stuff like. 
This for probably 6000 years and we're fine.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: Nobody's sick. We're fine. And so the mayor had to 
send out a meeting.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: To tell the health department back off of Chinatown. 
Yeah. Leave them alone. Yeah, and that it was 
finally resolved in that way.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: I figured there was money that changed hands 
Somewhere but you hey. Welcome to New York.
Bardin: That's so interesting. Well, ohh. My gosh. We, 
Sandy. We love talking to you. Thank you so much 
for agreeing to do our IT really helps us out. 
We. You're such. You're such an interesting 
person to talk to.
Davis: Oh, you're so welcome. Gabriel, Gabriela. Have you 
been to New York?
Whitmore: I have not. I have been really wanting to go, 
though. My best friend, she's from Connecticut, 
so we've been planning a trip to go.
Davis: Ah. Where in Connecticut?
Whitmore: She's from Weston, yeah.
Davis: Oh yeah. Well, so it's a real short train ride.
Whitmore: Yeah, yeah.
Davis: Yeah.
Davis: Well, how do you reckon you do? That yeah, yeah. 
These guys got to eat at the Italian place on New 
Year's Eve.
Bardin: Yes, it was so good.
Davis: And that's where I ate on Christmas Eve.
Bardin: Oh, really? That's awesome.
Davis: And then flew to Texas the next day, it was.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: What? What was the name of it? It's a real popular 
restaurant.
Bardin: Ohh gosh, I'm so bad.
Davis: I can't. I tell you about half of my vocabulary is 
always right on the.
Bardin: Tip of my tongue. Me too.
Davis: That's as far as it goes.
Bardin: I'm traveling.
Davis: Yeah, but you're not 70. I'm going to. Be 70 in May. 
How long did your grandpa?
Bardin: I'm trying to find. I took a picture. Sure. Let me 
see. It was right here. It was right by Carrie 
Bradshaw's apartment. I didn't take a picture of 
the name. It was in the West Village.
Davis: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Oh yeah, I. Know where it 
is.
Bardin: It's on Bedford St. Yes, I can't. I can't tell. 
It's West Village.
Davis: It's a tourist attraction. You see, but. But we 
locals are real snobs, we. We have two shits 
about that kind of thing, yeah. No, I mean we see 
like we see movie stars we're like, OK, Big deal 
so. What? Yeah, that was. And I'm you. Know 
you'll have somebody tell you what when you have 
somebody from out of state and they visit, it's 
exhausting #1. You have to keep your eye on them 
the entire time, because they'll just turn down 
the street. And then walk out in front of cars, 
yeah. You had. I had a friend there in may went 
we went to. He and I went Abilene Christian 
together. He's friend. He knows your grandpa and 
I 2 times. He was only there for four days. Two 
times I had to grab the back.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: Of his shirt this is a street. And there are cars 
now. Yeah. And they will run over you and you 
know and. He kind of just chuckled. But after a 
while I've got a friend that comes from Knoxville 
and you, you have to go. First of all, you have 
to keep your eye right on her.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: And every time you come up to any intersection, go 
left and you'll go the other way. OK, go left the 
other left. And you have to. It's like.
Bardin: OK.
Davis: I mean, she's like herding cats. Yes, you know. And 
so at one point I thought, you know what, I'm 
still let her go.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: Roam around and then she'll look up and tell I'm 
lost and call me on.
Bardin: The phone, yeah.
Davis: So I'm like, well, you know, hey.
Bardin: You gotta get it.
Davis: You get it. It's absolutely exhausting. Every time 
somebody comes, I'm always so glad they come. 
Davis: And when I leave.
Bardin: Well.
Davis: I'm like thank you God. That they say that they have 
left because. You get tired of explaining stuff.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: People that aren't that don't know what it's like 
inside the five boroughs, they don't get it.
Bardin: Yeah.
Davis: They don't, and you have to keep. Over and over. And 
well, why do they? Do that well, why do they do? 
This stop just stop. You're in Rome. Do as the 
Romans do.
Bardin: Yeah, that's for sure.
Davis: You know, so yeah, it's hard. It's hard.
Bardin: Yes. Well, I want to go back. I would love. Like, I 
feel like I've got the New York bug. Like you. 
Ever since I went on the vacation, I was like I 
could see myself here. It's so fun. Yeah, well, 
the of course the primary challenge is housing.
Bardin: Yes, exactly. It's too expensive.
Davis: I would like I thought I scored housing early on.
Bardin: Yes, for sure.
Davis: And I scored rent stabilized housing.
Bardin: Yes, that's.
Davis: I mean, if for somebody that's coming a new one new 
person. I would say try to find something in 
Hoboken or Jersey City or Weehawken.
Bardin: Uh-huh.
Davis: And it's cheaper and you take the train ride into 
the into the city.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: To go to work or to go to dinner. Or whatever it is 
you do.
Bardin: Uh.
Davis: Now, is it as fun as living right there in 
Manhattan? No, it's affordable.
Davis: And then once you start moving around and getting 
jobs and meeting people, all of a sudden somebody 
will come to you and say there's an apartment in 
my building.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: You know, but you have to be. You have to be able 
to. Put in the time and wait on it, New York is a 
very fickle mistress.
Bardin: Yes.
Davis: You have to put in the. Work to gain her trust. And 
then once you do that, you you're kind of stuck 
It's I saw I was great meme the other day on 
TikTok the guy said -- Starts off by complaining 
about New York, so expensive and crowded, and he 
goes. Yeah. But if it's not New York, it's 
nowhere.
Bardin: That's true.
Davis: He is so right. Once you have your blood. I mean, 
the idea of, you know, I was here off and on for 
10 years. and it was great because my mother and 
I were best friends? But once she went, there's 
nothing. I come into this House, it's empty. This 
time its empty. You can sing. This --
Bardin: There we go.
Davis: Sad song on the violin. Anyway, are you going to? 
Get out this way or what?
Bardin: I'm gonna probably stay in the Denton area. I 
really like Denton. Like after leaving there. 
Abilene coming here. I don't see myself going 
back.
Davis: Well, Denton is a is a very cool town. I have two 
brothers that I went to college with are from 
there. Their dad taught in one of the department. 
And one of them was wife taught in sociology. 
They both retired and they live out towards 
Aubrey. They built them a new house for 
retirement out toward Aubrey. Ohh. They've done 
very well. He worked for Peterbilt for 37 years 
and retired with a big old check. And so as it 
turns out, I may actually go to Denton. They 
asked me twice. Are you coming to Denton? If not, 
I'm coming to Abilene. All right. Well, OK. Come 
to Abilene.
