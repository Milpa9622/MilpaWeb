Place of Interview: Denton, Texas


 
Jordan Pingelton: Hi, this is Jordan Pingelton in Denton, 
Texas. Doing a little interview with Quinn 
Kettle. Quinn, would you like to introduce 
yourself?
Quinn Kettle: Hi, I'm Quinn Kettle in Denton, Texas 
[laughs].
Jordan Pingelton: Yes, I love that. So now we're just going 
to be kind of having a talk about food, about 
your job, about your life, about just kind of 
getting an oral history of you and food in your 
life and all those sorts of things.
Quinn Kettle: Purr, so is it going to be about me and food 
and my life?
Jordan Pingelton: I think that's going to be kind of our 
main three points for sure, definitely.
Quinn Kettle: [laughs] Okay, work.
Jordan Pingelton: So just kind of like to start out, can 
you kind of just give me an outline of your 
experience working in the food industry?
Quinn Kettle: Yeah. That's quite vague.
Jordan Pingelton: It is quite vague.
Kettle: That's quite vague.
Pingelton: So you can do, like, very general and I can 
source down from there.
Kettle: Okay, work, I started working in restaurants when I 
was 16. I started as a busser and a host. And 
then I really started working in restaurants at 
18 when I started serving. So I've been serving 
and bartending since then. I'm about to be 25, so 
however many years that is.
Pingelton: That's seven years.
Kettle: That's seven years of my life. I've been in 
restaurants and especially before I started 
dating my curtain partner, I was working doubles. 
Every single day. So I was working about 70 hour 
weeks. Yeah.
Pingelton: I didn't know that. That's insane.
Kettle: Yeah. I used to work crazy. Crazy. I was working 
doubles Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 
Sunday and sometimes Monday and Tuesday. If they 
would let me. So I was working a lot. I was 
making like 1500 + a week.
Pingleton: Wow.
Kettle: Which was dope. But one thing about working in the 
service industry like that and also what happens 
to most servers, especially because it's really 
difficult to get out of food service. You end up 
doing pretty irreparable damage to your body 
because you were just working, running, moving 
and it's not one of those jobs where you really 
get healthcare. So like I mean Janet, you know 
our coworker, she's mid 50s. Her body's fucked, 
so is Paul's, because they've been in food 
service their entire lives, and it's not. 
Necessarily a job that, like. Enables care, you 
know?
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: So my bones are basically like falling apart 
already and only 25. So yeah, there's not.
Pingelton: There's not. There is that so with that kind of 
like? How hard the job is, like what drew you to 
the restaurant industry in general initially?
Kettle: See, that's what's really interesting is that a lot 
of people, especially poor people, food service 
is a job that they kind of gravitate towards 
because one thing about working in food service, 
if you're poor and you can't afford groceries? 
You always have food. There's always food there.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: And so I started working restaurants because my 
family and I grew up very, very poor. And my dad 
would work the morning shift and my mom would 
work the night shift so that they were always 
working and there was always someone home to take 
care of me. And there was always food for us 
because we couldn't afford food on our own. So 
them working in restaurants, plus being able to 
bring home that money every day because that 
paycheck is just something that poor -- most poor 
people can't like live with, like having daily 
income is really important for someone that is 
just like drowning financially. And So there was 
that. And so I went into restaurants because 
that's what I grew up -- like literally someone 
would pick me up from school, like one of my 
dad's friends just drop me off at the restaurant 
that they worked at. And I would just sit there 
until my dad got off of work. So I was just 
comfortable in restaurants already and I'm really 
good with people. So yeah, my first job was at On 
the Border. And especially whenever I left my 
parents home 18, 19, no 19. It was really 
important for me to be working in a restaurant 
because I wouldn't have been able to get 
groceries, so.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Yeah. And now I just do it because it's the only 
thing I've ever done.
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: Yeah.
Pingelton: So like in this class, we've talked a lot about 
how like food ways aren't always traditional 
where -- and like food deserts exist and all that 
sorts of things. And you kind of touched on that 
as well. So. Can you talk about how like? Kind of 
like the back door. Like food industry is like 
either. Helped or hurt by the different like 
places that you've worked and like. If different 
managers were like had specific, do you know what 
I mean? Like crack down more on it or were more 
giving or just. 
Kettle: With food?
Pingelton: Yes.
Kettle: Yeah. So, honestly, I've never really had a manager 
that was very strict on people. Like being able 
to eat. Like as I mean. Cheddar's is -- actually 
while Cheddar's is very giving like our managers 
have said word for word "None of our staff is 
going to go hungry." Like "If you can't afford 
food, I'm going to buy food for you." They're the 
most strict in that, whenever like someone rings 
in an order, wrong or whatever, we throw that 
food away in every other restaurant ever worked 
out which has been a lot. The staff eats that 
food, which is the norm for most restaurants, 
which is what I find so weird about Cheddar's, is 
that we have so much food waste. But I guess 
Cheddar's does make up for that by donating food 
to the local food banks every week, which I think 
is really cool. But yeah, no, I think I've never 
really worked in a restaurant that wasn't giving, 
because that's just kind of like the nature of 
it. Like the manager, most managers other than 
Amy, Amy, some of the only manager I've ever had, 
that wasn't a server at one point, most managers 
have been in the server shoes and they know that. 
A lot of people can't afford to eat food, so 
they're like, yeah, I can eat it. You know, it's 
gonna get thrown away anyway. Or, like, let me 
buy you this or let me order pizza for everybody 
or whatever. Like, they make sure that the staff 
is fed. So yeah.
Pingelton: Yeah, I feel like. Because I -- we talked about 
in this class actually as well about like how 
certain fast food places like they're very strict 
about "No, you cannot eat our food, blah blah 
blah." And so I wonder like if it's. Like if 
there's some correlation between us getting paid 
$2.00 an hour and being able to like, eat food 
here and there and getting paid like a livable 
wage and not being able to eat.
Kettle: Yeah. See, I do think about that a lot because 
there's a lot that our managers will do or that 
the company will do for us instead of giving us a 
livable wage. You know, like they offer, I think 
it's like four free therapy sessions, a year 
through Garden, which is like cool. But can I at 
least get $7.00 an hour? 
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: You know, I'm like, can I pay my rent or like, 
whatever? And it's not like a real therapist. 
But, you know, like for anybody that has actual 
issues, it's not a therapist that you could go to 
like, I mean, I have borderline personality 
disorder can you imagine if I went to the Garden 
therapist and was like --
Pingelton: Hey, I really need help.
Kettle: I'm having thoughts of suicidal ideation. 
Pingelton: Yes and like. Okay. So our next session is going 
to be in three months, yeah.
Kettle: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. I don't know. That is a 
really interesting point. I never really thought 
about it, but there is a lot that they'll do 
that, I guess kind of like. Makes up for the fact 
that we don't have a wage.
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: But I'm cool with the food. I mean, there's been 
times where I would have to work every day, 
because otherwise I wouldn't eat otherwise, like 
I wouldn't be able to have any kind of access to 
food unless I was working at my restaurant job, 
which is something that most poor people will 
gravitate towards. Which is also why they're able 
to overwork people.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: So so easily is because they know that they need, 
like, those, the people that are, they are, they 
are overworking, wouldn't be able to survive 
otherwise. So.
Pingelton: With that, there's kind of like with what you 
just said, it's it kind of there's that saying 
that like disparities are most obvious in the 
food and hospitality industries, like hotels and 
restaurants and so.
Kettle: Yeah.
Pingelton: I feel like. It's an interesting like, it's kind 
of just, the capitalistic machine in general, 
where you need to work to live --
Kettle: Yeah I mean --
Pingelton: But in food service it's so poignant.
Kettle: In foodservice, it really is. So like abhorrently 
true like the was it the the blood of the working 
class greases the wheel of capitalism. You know, 
like if it weren't for and it it is crazy to me 
because so many, like rich people or even just 
like upper middle class people talk shit on food 
service workers.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: But they're the people that you're abusing in that 
restaurant. You know, like they're the people 
that, I mean, I don't know. How many horrible 
guest experiences have you--? You've had, but I 
mean, I've been working since I was skinny, 
blonde and 18, you know? So I was treated very 
differently then than I am now. Now people, for 
the most part respect me because I guess I look 
mean. I don't know. That's something that I've 
heard from a lot of our coworkers and also from 
customers. They're like, "You look scary, but 
you're nice." But whatever. I was 18, blonde and 
skinny. It was very different and people treated 
me like shit. Or very sexually creepy, which is 
so weird to like, go somewhere with your family 
to eat food and share a meal. And I feel like 
sharing a meal is very like. I don't know food 
has been important in so many cultures and like 
sharing like --
Pingelton: Engrained in every culture, yeah.
Kettle: Yeah, exactly. And so like going and being waited 
on by somebody, first of all, not even just like 
the sexually weirdness or whatever. But like, 
treating them like they're an animal, almost like 
you're so far above them when you wouldn't be 
able to be at this restaurant being waited at if 
I didn't work here.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: You know, like, whenever -- Like. On holidays, 
Easter and stuff like that and people are like, 
"Why are you working here on Easter?" And like 
girl? Because you're here, you know, because 
you're here on Easter. That's why I have to work 
on Easter. People treat waitresses so weird. 
Pingelton: So weird. 
Kettle: So weird and like just so casually, like, creepy, 
misogynistic. Demeaning. Like I remember a couple 
of months ago. I've heard this so many times over 
my serving career, which is weird. I'm like, do 
you guys take a class now to be creepy? But, 
whenever I -- I was like, is your tea sweet 
enough? In that case, I had to, like, remake it 
because he said it wasn't sweet he was like "It'd 
be sweet enough if you dipped your finger in it, 
and swirled it around a bit." I was like, that's 
so bizarre to say to somebody, that's so weird to 
say. Or, oh my God, whenever I first started 
working at Cheddar's. It was really late. These 
two like biker looking dudes came in with one of 
their sons and it was like this, like 10 year old 
kid. And he was like really shy and really 
embarrassed. And his dad kept making jokes that 
he was shy because he wanted to have sex with me. 
This child wanted to have sex. With me. And 
that's why he was so shy. And he was like, "Don't 
worry, you'll be able to do that one day." And I 
was. This is a really weird position to put me 
in, and also you're joking about your 10 year old 
kid having sex with a 25 year old. 
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: You know, super weird.
Pingelton: And then there's like that overarching dynamic 
that makes the behavior 'allowable', in quotation 
marks of, well, "I'm paying your bills. So I can 
do whatever I want."
Kettle: Mm-hmm. They can treat you however they wanna 
because they are paying you. And what's crazy is 
like they're usually not gonna pay you that much.
Pingelton: [unclear]
Kettle: Like the tables that treat you that way are not 
even tipping 20%. 
Pingelton: No.
Kettle: And it's it's crazy that they they think that 
because.
Pingelton: I don't know like and a lot of old people also I 
guess don't really realize that we are only 
making $2.13 and that never went up like.
Pingelton: Mmhm.
Kettle: And so they'll have like $100 tab that they tip 7 
bucks on.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: They're like "What you made 7 bucks?" and I'm like. 
Yeah, that doesn't pay for literally anything 
these days.
Pingelton: Anything.
Kettle: That's like, not even the cost of like, two large 
white Monster cans, [laughs] like.
Pingelton: No, literally.
Kettle: Like, I'm like, hello. Well, that can't buy me 
anything.
Pingelton: Yeah like you might get lucky with like a sale 
at 7-11, but that's like you're betting on sales.
Kettle: Yeah, yeah, I remember. God, I was 19. I was 
working two serving job. No, I was working two 
restaurant jobs. One was a hosting job, one was a 
serving job and I was really broke. I was really, 
really broke. There was some shit going on in the 
-- Oh, sorry am I allowed to --? 
Pingelton: No you're good [laughs].
Kettle: There was, there was there was something going on 
in the economy at that time. I don't remember but 
everybody was really poor. And so like, whenever 
the economy dips, obviously it affects 
restaurants. People tip less, people tip more in 
cash, which is interesting. And, I remember I had 
a car. I wasn't speaking to my parents, this was 
after I moved out, and so I was really poor. I 
had no money and I was like sneaking that, oh, 
that restaurant was really strict about free 
food. It was a ma and pop restaurant, which for 
the most part, ma and pop, mom and pop 
restaurants treat you very differently than 
corporations because, like, you're affecting 
their direct profit and not the profit of, like, 
a conglomerate.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: And so I had no money. They would not help me out 
with food. I did, like, steal pieces of garlic 
bread because I didn't have any food. It was 
horrible. And I remember I was. I had to bus 
tables because we got really busy. And someone 
had left a $10.00 bill on the table, and whenever 
I had driven to work, I had 0 miles left in gas. 
I was like, I need to make some kind of. I need 
to figure out how to get home. Like, I don't have 
any money. And I remember I think about this 
everyday. I stole that guy's $10 tip because I 
didn't have any other way to get home. And I was 
like, I hope he never finds out. And then I heard 
him talking about how upset he was because he was 
like "That table really liked me. I don't know 
why they didn't tip." And I felt so bad that it 
crumbled up the tent and I threw it under his 
booth and I was hoping that he would just find 
it. And he was like, "Hey, I saw you just throw a 
piece of trash under my table. What did you do 
that for?" And I was like --
Pingelton: Oh my gosh.
Kettle: "I'm sorry." And so I picked it up and put it in my 
pocket. And I wasn't able to -- and like, I got 
gas, and I was able to get home but I think about 
all the time because that restaurant did not give 
a fuck about you.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Did not care, and a lot of people think that 
corporations are the evil ones when it comes to 
restaurants, but corporations are usually the 
ones where poor people are working because that's 
the only way you can really make money is by 
working for a corporation and that's the only way 
you get treated like a human being because 
there's HR and there's all these different 
things. And I literally think about that. 
Experience all the time. I had no food and I had 
to steal this guy's tip. And then I tried to give 
it back and he was like, "Pick it up!" and I was 
like, "I'm sorry!" [laughs] I'm a horrible 
person.
Pingelton: And with that, like he, there's also there's 
like the very real, like monetary side to 
serving. And then also there's the part where he 
didn't get a tip and he was like, oh, I thought 
they liked me. Like, there's this very real part 
of serving where. You are like helping people to 
break bread together like and to use, like 
biblical terms, or whatever.
Kettle: Yeah absolutely.
Pingelton: And so like, do you still feel after you're 
like, you're varied experiences in the industry 
and everything that like there is like. A sort 
of, not religious, but like very important aspect 
to your job. Like do you like? Do you know what 
I'm saying?
Kettle: I mean, I think food service has always been very 
important and it will continue to be. But I mean 
it's one of the oldest professions, you know, 
and.
Pingelton: Hmm.
Kettle: Like. One thing is even if you're really poor, one 
thing that you're able to do with your family is 
go out for a meal together. And serving is 
important because you're able to, you know, 
facilitate that. And hopefully if you're a good 
server, you're able to make them laugh and you're 
able to. I mean, like, it sounds cheesy to like. 
Bring them closer together for that moment, you 
know. And there's there's tables that I've waited 
on that have made like a permanent impact on my 
life also. Like I have this couple of regulars. 
Their names are June and Earl, and they were the 
first table I ever waited on at Cheddar's and 
they have been seeing me consistently ever since. 
They always come in to sit in my section and the 
older man has cataracts so he can't see me very 
well, but his wife is very sweet. Um and um, they 
talk to me about their life and they talk about 
how neither of them work. All they do is garden 
all day and they don't cook. They don't have any 
groceries in the house. All they do is go out to 
eat at restaurants. That's how they survive 
because neither-- or his hands don't work very 
well. So he can't help her cook. And she has to 
be with him at all times, to take care of him, so 
they just go out to eat together all the time, 
literally for every single meal. And like for 
Christmas, they like wrote me a Christmas card 
and gave me $100 tip. Like. And there's tables 
that like I remember whatever my. I like went 
through a breakup or something and I was having 
really hard day because like, that's, that's 
another thing that serving serving is no matter 
what's going on in your life, you have to be 
there and you have to be a good server. And some 
tables care enough to ask you how you're doing 
and want an actual answer. And so like, there's 
tables that I've like become friends with and 
they've become like, intricate parts of my life 
through just waiting on them. Because like it's 
an experience together, you know and. Yeah, I 
don't know. Also had really weird experiences 
where, like I remember I had only been working at 
Cheddar's for like 3 or 4 months and I was 
working in the cocktail area and I waited on this 
couple that I thought was really kind, you know, 
like they were. We were chilling. You know, they 
tipped me $2.00. And then right on the back of 
the receipt. My old lady thinks you're 
attractive. Here's her number if you want to go 
on a date with her. 
Pingelton: Oh wow.
Kettle: And so like, a lot of people will like. Either like 
sexually or romantically or like just vocally 
give you a tip and they won't give you money. And 
they think that that, like, makes up for it, 
which is really weird. I don't know if you have a 
weird view of servers.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Sometimes they don't view you as a human they view 
as an object.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Or like a robot or a slave or something.
Pingelton: Or like you're permanently there, like you're 
like, soul bonded to the restaurant and you never 
leave and like stuff like that.
Kettle: Or if something goes wrong, they act like you did 
it.
Pingelton: Yes, yes. 
Kettle: Like if their food came out burnt and you weren't 
the one that ran their food so you didn't notice. 
And then they act like you burnt their food 
because you want them to die, you know.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: I don't know.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Yeah. 
Pingelton: I-- you brought up an interesting point, or you 
made me think of an interesting point. Maybe 
where that Earl was his name. Right? He goes out 
to eat a lot because he has, like, difference in 
ability like, so with, like, food ways and how we 
eat and like nutrition and stuff like that I feel 
like, restaurants are very important in that way 
because we are the restaurants located like kind 
of down the road from a hospital. And a lot of 
times you'll see people come in and they have 
hospital wristbands on a lot, yes.
Kettle: A lot of people, a lot of older people with like 
literal wounds on their heads and hands. And 
mothers that just gave birth and like, literally 
just gave birth, and a bunch of stuff. A lot of 
people come from that hospital yeah.
Pingelton: So I feel like it's like an interesting thing 
too, where no matter what. Like, accommodations 
you need whenever you go to a restaurant, there's 
the like, and I think tipping culture helps with 
this in a way, because a lot of people are like, 
get rid of tipping culture, dadadadadadadada.
Kettle: Which is so messed up.
Pingelton: You think?
Kettle: Yeah!
Pingelton: Okay, put a pin in that. Put a pin in that. 
We'll come back. We'll come back. But. With like 
specifically people who are differently abled or 
have a disability and they're like life 
experience, they like in a certain way. Certain 
servers who might not want to be accommodating 
have to be because their tip like relies on that.
Kettle: Yeah your livelihood relies on it.
Pingelton: Yeah. 
Kettle: And but what's what's really interesting about 
that? Like. There's a lot of servers that are 
solely money driven, which is understandable. I 
mean, it's your profession, you know? But I also 
like, I don't know why you would pick serving of 
all things if you don't want to make a connection 
with people you know. Because I think like food 
and people in the connection there is like the 
biggest part of the job. And that's also how you 
make the most money is by making a connection 
with people. Like, why wouldn't you care about 
their abilities?
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: And why wouldn't you care about, like, wanting them 
to be comfortable and have an experience for 
something that they're splurging for? Or like? 
Like Earl in June, who come in because his hands 
do not work enough to help her cook and they, 
they don't, they, they can't go to the grocery 
store all the time, you know? Like, like those 
moments are really special. And I like, like, 
there's a bunch of people in wheelchairs that 
come in to Cheddar's. And like kids that can't 
feed themselves and so their parents have to feed 
them and. Some servers act really fucked up about 
it.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: You know? Or they'll, like, make fun of them in the 
back. And I'm like. Hello? Like this is a 
universal experience coming to a restaurant and 
being fed, you know?
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: And obviously these people need this moment, and 
they need this time out of the house, and they 
need to be able to eat cause they can't cook for 
themselves and they need all these different. So 
I don't understand why you would be acting like 
that.
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: But I don't know. Maybe that's just me.
Pingelton: No, it's like it's also this weird thing with 
the feeling that people are treating you like an 
object. There's, like, a reciprocity with it, 
where you're like, "Well, I don't care. I just 
need to get my check" or "I just need to like get 
a bigger tip."
Kettle: "I just need to make 50 more dollars." You know?
Pingelton: Yes.
Kettle: And so. Then those people become an object to you. 
Which is something that we all complain about, as 
being viewed an object. But then you're just 
viewing these people as like, a --
Pingelton: A paycheck.
Kettle: A cash cow. You know?
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: When they're just people.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: I feel like. It would be much easier to work in the 
restaurant industry if both parties viewed each 
other as human beings. You know what I mean?
Pingelton: Yeah, literally. And so a lot of people 
attribute that like, that relationship, and that 
strife to tipping culture. But it sounds like you 
don't view that, like, or do you? What's your 
view on tipping culture? You said you don't want 
to get rid of it. Or you do? Or you don't?
Kettle: Hmm. I mean, I think. I mean, well, I think there's 
several different sides to it in that like, I am 
providing you a service. You know, if you went, 
if you did not want to be waited on. Which is an 
intricate part of working at a restaurant, is 
like or being at a restaurant as you are being 
waited on by someone who is getting you 
everything that you could possibly need. And 
more, and anticipating your needs. And like you 
know, and trying to make a connection with you 
and everything. Like if you didn't want to, pay 
them for your experience, then go to a fast food 
restaurant. You know, like where they are being 
paid. First of all, a living wage which you know. 
And also they're just like doing a job. They're 
not doing a service.
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: You know what I mean? I mean like, and, you know, 
it makes me think about. I was watching this tik 
tok and this woman had won some contest where she 
got a free, a wedding planner. And she was 
talking to the wedding planner and she was 
talking about how she thinks that wedding 
planners should be free because everyone needs 
one and they're like, you know, whatever. And 
then she was kind of like how waiting, waiters 
and waitresses are free. And the one she was 
talking to was like, "What do you mean?" And she 
was like, "Well, they're free. They're just there 
to be part of the restaurant." And it's like, 
what do you mean? I'm just there to be part of 
the restaurant. I'm doing my job and doing a 
service, you know? And you should be giving me 
money for that. And I also think on top of the 
fact that, like, duh, I'm doing a job and you 
should be paying me because that's how it's 
fucking always worked. On top of that, you should 
have some care for human beings knowing that. 
Cause everybody, unless you're a million years 
old, knows that I'm making $2.13 an hour. 
Everybody knows that. And like, if you have the 
opportunity to make someone's life easier by like 
paying them for the service that they're doing, 
and knowing that like. The world does not go 
around unless we are helping each other. And 
goods and services, and all of the different 
things, you know, all those things, and if you do 
not want to tip someone because you do not see 
the value in another human being and the services 
that they're giving you. Then I don't think you 
should go to a fucking restaurant. I don't think 
you should go to a coffee shop if you don't feel 
the need to tip your barista. They're not just 
there. They're not just a thing to do a thing for 
you. They are a human being and you are paying 
them for the goods and services you are 
receiving, which is how things have worked for 
the entirety of all time, you know what I mean?
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: So yeah, no, I think tipping culture is important. 
Whenever it comes to. A corporation that on their 
self checkout at a grocery store has a tipping 
option.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Yeah, obviously no. But we all know that that's 
going to a corporation that is fueled by greed, 
not from a human being who's like. Who's a single 
mom and has three kids at home and has to work 
doubles and pay a babysitter to keep her head and 
her children's heads above water. You know, why 
wouldn't you want to tip that woman, you know, 
like?
Pingelton: Right. And there's this weird thing where it's 
like, I see so many videos where it's like 
tipping culture has gone too far, but like. It's 
no, yeah.
Kettle: It's not. And I think it's gone as far as it 
should.
Pingelton: Yeah. 
Kettle: I think that more people should care about people 
being financially stable. And I think more people 
should, you know, more people should care about 
their community. More people instead of throwing 
away cans of food that you're not going to eat, 
should be donating that to the food bank more 
people. That see a homeless person on the side of 
the street that is asking for money should be 
giving that person money and not asking where 
it's coming, where it's going to.
Pingelton: Yes.
Kettle: You know what I mean? Like, that's another like. 
That's like, a lot of people think that when they 
see a homeless man on the side of the street that 
if they go get him food and give it to him that 
they're doing better than someone giving him 
money. Which I don't agree with because that food 
can go bad. What if they just ate? What if blah 
blah blah. And also you don't have control over 
what that person does, with the money that you're 
giving them. I get that people think that by 
giving them food, they're doing the best service 
possible. They're not. That food goes bad, the 
food gets bugs in it. They have no way to store 
that food, they have blah blah blah blah blah, 
you know. And like, if I gave you $10 just as a 
gift, I wouldn't be like by the way, don't spend 
it on this. You know, I don't know.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: I just think more people should care about the 
community and I think food service comes into 
that.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: And you know, I mean, it. Food has always been a 
way of connection. You go to a funeral or like 
the wake or whatever you bring a dish for the 
family so that they don't have to worry about 
cooking and stuff like that, you know? And. I 
just don't see why someone would come with their 
family after a celebration and want to share a 
meal together and then look at me like I'm not a 
human. And why wouldn't you want to tip me. Like 
you, tell me why. You know, like I just want to 
look those people, people in the eyes and just 
say why do you think tipping culture should not 
exist?
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: Because you not tipping me isn't going to do 
anything about what the restaurant thinks about 
my hourly wage.
Pingelton: Exactly.
Kettle: So who were you helping?
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: You know?
Pingelton: I remember this one lady came in and like, I 
remembered having her and she like, specifically 
was like "I need a spoon for my corn." Because 
she, like, didn't want to eat it with a fork. And 
I was like, okay, work whatever and I bring her a 
spoon the second time she comes in because I 
remember her. And she's like, "Oh, my God. Thank 
you. Yeah, we've had you before." And I was like, 
struggling to remember why I remembered her? From 
like a long time ago, whatever the check comes, 
they leave, no tip. So, we like formed a human 
connection and, no tip. So I think that's also an 
interesting thing.
Kettle: It's dehumanizing.
Pingelton: Yes, exactly. But, whenever there is that 
connection there, I'm like. I'm just so confused 
because you can afford it because it's like 
you're, like, doing math on the menu to like 
order the perfect amount and like, drain your 
bank account to $0. Like I understand eating 
cheap or whatever, but it's this weird thing 
where, like community building goes so far. 
Because I do think, I agree that, like, food 
service. And food in general is very community 
building and like, learning what people like, and 
like getting regulars is like this whole little 
micro like, economy and stuff.
Kettle: Yeah.
Pingelton: But there's this weird wall. Where. There, 
there's just some wall. Do you know what I'm 
saying?
Kettle: Yeah, I do kind of get what you're saying. I think 
it's really, me and a bunch of people we work 
with all the time. We always talk about how weird 
it is that the people that we think are going to 
tip us really well, are the people that stiff us. 
And the people that treat us like shit are the 
people that tip us over 20%. It's so weird. It 
really is weird, but there is. I don't know, I 
think. I think you know we have some coworkers 
that complain about how there's no money in this 
business, or there's no money in this restaurant 
and all of this, all this shit. And I'm like, 
there is, if you do your job right, you know? 
Like, if you just walk up to the table and you're 
like, what can I get you to drink, you know? And 
you treat these people like they're pieces of 
shit that are just going to give you money then, 
like, yeah, you're not going to make any money. 
You're going to have a bad time. But like for me, 
I build a connection with everyone of my tables. 
Because first of all, I love to, I love to yap. 
And so I'm yappin' with my tables. And half of my 
regulars are gay couples like, yeah, elderly, gay 
men are my customer base. Like, I I have this one 
set of regulars that comes in all the fucking 
time. And sometimes they come with their friends, 
which is a lesbian couple, and a gay couple, and 
them. And, but for the most part, most part it's 
the the older gay couple and one of their moms. 
And they come in all the time and I see them. And 
then I just go get them a Coke Zero, a water, and 
a Diet Coke. And I know they don't want 
croissants and I know their exact order. And we 
talk about what their wedding was like, and we 
talk about what my wedding is going to be like 
and they just have seen pictures of Beck. They 
ask how Beck is doing, you know, and it's like. A 
lot of our coworkers, whenever I talk about these 
things, are like bewildered that I have this 
relationship with these people and I'm like, 
well, if you just talk to them. You know? And 
they always tip $10, you know? And so like, it's 
nice knowing that I have this connection with 
them. And that I know for sure they are always 
going to tip me $10.
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: Because that $10 can really like push you over. 
[laughs] You know, it really can.
Pingelton: Yeah, for sure.
Kettle: And. They, like accidentally. They're not 
accidentally, they made extra cookies a couple 
weeks ago, and they, like, brought me a tin of 
cookies, you know? And it's like little, like, 
tokens of affection through food that I think are 
really important. I don't know. I love working in 
a restaurant.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: I talk to you about it all the time, but I --
Pingelton: Of course.
Kettle: Really, I really do love it.
Pingelton: Yeah. And I feel like that you're mentioning 
this little adorable couple, kind of like segues 
into another part of the conversation that I 
think is really interesting in that. You're 
queer. Talk about that.
Kettle: [laughes]
Pingelton: [laughs] No, just kidding. But really, we kind 
of talked about this a little bit like 
individually, but now we're gonna get it 
recorded, like, down on the record. But just 
maybe begin with. Kind of identifying yourself in 
as many words as you want, or as little words as 
you want. or whatever. Just like set of basis. 
Because I don't think we've said that yet for 
the. Recording that like.
Kettle: Okay, I'm a lesbian and I am non binary. Um, so 
yeah.
Pingelton: So there you go.
Kettle: I'm gender queer and a big old lady loving lesbian, 
and my tables love that, they eat it up. [laughs] 
They eat it up.
Pingelton: [laughs] And so, with that, there's. And we live 
in Texas. Well, obviously, we're recording this 
in Denton, Texas, as we said at the beginning --
Kettle: Denton, Texas! Denton, Texas.
Pingelton: Okay.
Kettle: Work. [laughs]
Pingelton: [laughs] Okay. Yes, yes. And so there's a lot of 
like. "Ma'am", a lot of like "Sir", those types 
of things. 
Kettle: Mmhm, Yeah. 
Pingelton: And you do not identify with those words in your 
regular life?
Kettle: No.
Pingelton: Only at your job.
Kettle: Yeah, you have to put on a show.
Pingelton: Yes.
Kettle: You know, you have to be what the people are 
looking for. And with tables like my gay 
regulars. Like the gay couples or the lesbian 
couples that come with the baby that I'm able to 
connect with on that personal level, and I'm able 
to take that wall down with them, it's different. 
But with every other table, I can only show them 
the bits of my queerness that are acceptable.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: And that they can, like commodify. Does that make 
sense?
Pingelton: Absolutely.
Kettle: Like the bits that they can be like. "Ohh yeah, a 
lesbian waited on me today. How crazy." You know 
what I mean? But I can't. I can't let them see 
the stuff that they might not agree with, because 
that directly affects not only my safety. They 
know where I work, you know.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: But it also would affect my money.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: And so there's with a lot of things with my gender 
identity, with me being gay, I know there's 
certain tables that I cannot talk to about that. 
Like you can see it, you cannot talk to them 
about that. With our coworkers, with our 
Hispanic, and with our Black coworkers. There are 
certain tables that they wait on that they have 
to change bits of themselves, because they come 
in in a MAGA hat, you know?
Pingelton: Mmhm, yes.
Kettle: And so they have to know how to act around those 
tables because not only would it affect your 
money, but it also would affect your safety. And, 
so there's only there's bits and pieces, there's 
things with serving that you have to put up with. 
Because otherwise it will directly affect your 
job.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Like or your like I said, your safety. So yeah, 
it's really exhausting. It feels like whenever I 
get home, I take a shower and I'm like, washing 
off this other person --
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: That I have to put on because I'm. I'm also on the 
spectrum so, it's like there's a there's like an 
energy that I have to uphold and like a mask that 
I have to put on with these tables that whenever 
I'm home, it's like literally taking off the 
fucking heaviest jacket, you know, and like, just 
dropping it and being like, "Oh my God, I can be 
a human person again." And not just like, just 
like this object. That's like, you know.
Pingelton: Like automaton, with the little, and.
Kettle: Mmhm, mmhm. Yeah, absolutely. Like, I don't know.
Pingelton: Yeah, I like. I think it's really interesting 
that when I brought up this topic, one of the 
first words of your mouth is like performance. 
Like, literally this job requires you to perform 
your gender that you were assigned at birth.
Kettle: Yeah, I feel like I'm a dancing monkey, you know? 
Mm-hmm.
Pingelton: No. Yes.
Kettle: Mmhm, absolutely.
Pingelton: Like, I feel like even with men, like.
Kettle: Especially.
Pingelton: They are the, like, very masculine men -- do 
very well at our restaurant.
Kettle: Very well.
Pingelton: And they play it up more than like when they 
talk to me, obviously.
Kettle: Yeah.
Pingelton: And so we're kind of in between that. Because 
you're not going to, like, put your hair in 
pigtails and. Like -
Kettle: No, yeah.
Pingelton: Dance about. And I'm not gonna go talk about 
football at a table, so we have to carve out this 
weird like niche where we're funny enough, but 
not too, like, racy.
Kettle: Queer enough, but not too in your face.
Pingelton: Exactly.
Kettle: Yeah. To where you can be something that those 
people want to look at.
Pingelton: Yes.
Kettle: But not something that is going to make them 
uncomfortable.
Pingelton: Absolutely.
Kettle: Which is, like, so difficult to make your money off 
of that, you know, like to make your money off of 
chipping away parts of yourself, to be easily 
digested by someone that you don't know, but your 
money relies on them. You know? It really is 
interesting and, there's tables that I make the 
mistake of letting to see too much of me.
Pingelton: Yes!
Kettle: And then I have to reap that. Like um, tables that 
start to make lesbian sex jokes. Or I mentioned 
my partner and then they say, "Do lesbians really 
scissor?"
Pingelton: Woah.
Kettle: And then I have to be like. [laughs] You know?
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Because if you get upset with them, that's 
something about working at a corporation. You 
can't defend yourself in the way that you would 
like.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Because you can get fired, you know, because that 
has to go through HR. If if something happens 
between me and a customer. If I say "You can't 
make a joke about me being a dyke." You know, 
"You can't use that word."
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: You can't. Whatever, whatever, whatever. And they 
bring it to HR. It doesn't matter how much my 
general manager loves me. It doesn't matter how 
many connections I've made with these people, and 
it doesn't matter the experiences that I've given 
them or shown them different sides of something 
they've never thought about before. You know, it 
doesn't matter any of that if this one person, is 
uncomfortable by me or by the way they acted that 
I didn't. Whatever, whatever I can lose my job. 
Yeah. So it's like you. You have to be so fucking 
careful to only show bits and pieces of yourself, 
which is really difficult. Like we we used to 
work with a trans woman named Iris and she did 
not pass, at all. And she would introduce herself 
as Iris. And, you know, talk 'womanly' and, you 
know [unclear] hers was consistently like a 40. 
Like she was not digested by our clientele at 
all. And it's so horrible. Because like, it goes 
all the way back to the end of the conversation 
where this is where poor people work, because 
they can always get food, and because it is day 
by day, money. But if you are not something that 
is easily digestible by the public, quote UN 
quote, which our our clientele is mostly 
Republicans, you know.
Pingelton: For sure.
Kettle: So if you're not easily digested by a Republican, 
if you're not a lesbian that they can picture 
sexually, if you're not a trans person that they 
can picture sexually in a taboo way to them, then 
you're not making any money.
Pingelton: No.
Kettle: You know, if I'm waiting on men who were flirting 
with me and I. Shut it down. I'm not making any 
money. If I'm whatever, whatever. If I don't 
laugh at their jokes, if I don't. Whatever. Then, 
like the whole job, is fucking pointless.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: It's literally fucking performance, and it's an 
exhausting one.
Pingelton: Right.
Kettle: And and like it can be really emotionally damaging 
too.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: But you just have to, like, keep doing it because 
otherwise like. You wouldn't have anything, you 
know?
Pingelton: Right. Yeah. And so like. With that, they're 
like, kind of to lighten up a little.
Kettle: [laughs]
Pingelton: What do you --
Kettle: Sorry did I get too --
Pingelton: No, no! But just in like I don't want to just 
say like, "So what's so hard about your life?" 
You know what I mean? We don't have to do that. 
But like, how do you kind of like, you talked 
about going home and showering and not feeling 
very transformative like you're literally taking 
off a mask or like something like that? What else 
do you do to kind of like, this is a very, like, 
vogue, what do you do to recharge?
Kettle: Well, honestly, it depends on what the day was 
like. So like there's days where I will have a 
very fucking bad day at work where people treated 
me like a dog, you know? And those days, I kind 
of just like, I mean, people can see it on me at 
work, you know. Like I'm not able to bounce back 
as easily as some of the other people that we 
work with because I think most of the other 
people that we work with don't deal with it in 
the way that I do. Or I'm sure that you do, you 
know, as very openly, queer looking people, or 
sounding people or whatever. So, but like for me, 
sometimes I just have to go home and sit on the 
shower floor and I have to just sit there and 
then I have to just be silent, and have, like, 
doom scrolling phone time for a while before I 
feel like, ready to talk to another human being. 
It's a draining job and all, it's also a job that 
breeds alcoholism and addiction.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: Um, which is something that I'm happy that I got 
out of, but it, you know, I am an addict and it. 
Did. Breed that you know, because like sometimes 
the only way that you can get through a shift is 
coke. You know, like a lot of, like, I remember I 
worked at Chili's is the one over on the loop. 
And they were all doing it all the time because 
everybody was. Working doubles every day because 
it's such good money. But the only way you can 
get through the doubles is by having a stimulant, 
you know? Yeah. So like historically breeds 
addiction. And so yeah, now that I don't have 
that, I kind of just take a two-hour long shower 
and watch a really good movie.
Pingelton: Really good movie.
Kettle: [laughs] Or like binge RuPaul, which is something 
I've been doing a lot, yeah.
Pingelton: Yeah. I yeah. I do that too, like literally. And 
it's not like I work so much or anything like 
that, but like those, those hours that you lose 
in transit to and from like a draining job? Umm, 
because other people have jobs and they're very 
draining, like working at McDonald's is very 
physically hard. But you're not having to like, 
be a comedian and like, make sure you look nice, 
specifically.
Kettle: See things with McDonald's are draining in a 
different way. 
Pingelton: Exactly.
Kettle: Because of the way that people look at you.
Pingelton: Yeah true.
Kettle: You know, because like, I mean, McDonald's pays 
$15.00 an hour.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: You know. But the people that are looking at the 
people that work at McDonald's are not thinking 
about that. That's the same amount that I think 
Target pays.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: You're working at Target. You're going to be 
treated in a very different way than you are 
working at McDonald's, but people aren't gonna 
stop going to McDonald's, but they are going to 
keep shitting on you. You know, that's what. 
That's what's so weird about. It is like these 
people treat waiters and waitresses, and fast 
food workers, and bartenders as like these, like 
less than things.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: When again, oldest profession is food service other 
than like sex work, you know?
Pingelton: Yeah literally.
Kettle: And so it's like, I don't understand why I would be 
less than you when I have to be here for you to 
get what you want.
Pingelton: Exactly.
Kettle: So I don't know.
Pingelton: And I think that's, like an interesting point 
about how specifically food service is so. Like, 
subjugated, in our culture because in a lot of 
ways, like we serve, we serve like Southern 
comfort food, which is rooted in, like slavery.
Kettle: Yeah, absolutely.
Pingelton: A lot of the things we serve are like were 
developed by enslaved people.
Kettle: Mmhm.
Pingelton: And so, or even like McDonald's, like the 
hamburger, like these types of cuisines that 
aren't seen as, you know, French cuisine or 
Italian cuisine. These types of industries and 
these types of restaurants are subjugated like 
that. And I think it brings in like an 
interesting conversation about kind of. Who gets 
to decide what's authentic? Who gets to decide 
what is 'good food', in quotation marks? And so I 
kind of, you're I think you're an expert in your 
field.
Kettle: [laughs] I would say so, yeah.
Pingelton: I would say so, and so kind of like. What's your 
like Quinn's guide to the Galaxy for like? 
Service or like where do you see it happening in 
the next few years? Cause I feel like COVID 
really changed the service industry --
Kettle: COVID changed so much.
Pingelton: So if you want to touch on that.
Kettle: I was working in a restaurant on COVID happened. It 
was horrifying because we didn't know much about 
it. Whenever the pandemic first hit, and all we 
knew was I have to touch people's food, you know. 
I have to touch people's food. And then I have to 
touch the food, the plates that they ate off of, 
and the cups that they drink out of. And it was 
so crazy because. Uh. People were talking about 
like, how scary COVID is and whatever, but they 
weren't thinking about the food service workers 
in that at all.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: But they weren't going to stop going to 
restaurants.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: You know, and it was crazy because our managers 
didn't even really think about our safety, 
they're like "Put on gloves", "I don't know put 
on a mask if you want, but you need to keep 
coming to work." And I was like, people are 
dying. [laughs] Like people are dying. I don't 
know. I mean, the trick to being a good server is 
just making yourself swallowable enough. Like 
making yourself easier to chew on, you know, and 
giving them a good experience and making sure 
that they don't have anything to yell at you 
about. I mean, that's really the only way you get 
through it, is just by doing just enough. But you 
also have to think about how the public doesn't 
really give a fuck about you and your management 
probably don't either. [laughs] So it's an 
interesting job.
Pingelton: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think --
Kettle: [laughs]
Pingelton: Just checking the time we're nearing the end for 
sure. But I kind of want to go back over my notes 
and just let me think of anything that I want to 
go over again, or maybe think of. Oh, here's one 
that I wrote down. This is my first question that 
I had written that I haven't asked yet.
Kettle: Okay.
Pingelton: But kind of in light of everything that we 
talked about like. And. Just kind of what we're 
supposed to do with this interview or whatever. 
What does the restaurant represent to you in 
American life and life in general, and where do 
you think like. Because I think we're at kind of 
a tipping point in history --
Kettle: Mmhm, for sure.
Pingelton: And where do you think that food service is 
going to go? Where do you see yourself in that? 
Where does the restaurant settle in kind of this 
America that's constantly earthquaking and.
Kettle: I mean, we're always going to be here. That's the 
one thing about working in a restaurant is those 
jobs are always going to be needed. You can move 
anywhere and find a job within two days, you 
know. Like no matter what's going on in the 
world, even through like the 2008 fucking 
financial crisis where no one had any money, 
restaurants were still there through the 
pandemic, restaurants were still there, you know. 
I don't think anything is really going to affect 
my job personally. I'm always going to have one 
even if I left Cheddar's, I can go and get 
another restaurant job that day. I have never 
left an interview without the job, you know, 
especially like having experience. So, but I'm 
not sure if I'm going to keep making the same 
money. You know.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: I used to. I used to work 12 hour shifts. Friday, 
Saturday, Sunday leave at 1500 bucks, and now I'm 
lucky if I make four hundred, five hundred maybe 
it's a really good day. So, honestly with, as 
long as I've been working in restaurants, I have 
no idea what's in store for us. I have absolutely 
no idea. I have no idea what's going to happen. 
Things change every day, you know, especially 
with the clientele that we have.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: I don't even know if it's going to be safe for me 
to be working there for much longer, you know, 
because, like, especially with. You know, things 
that are happening across the world with wars and 
genocides and things. And having any form of 
opinion on that if they ask you a question and 
you answer it wrong, they could hurt you, you 
know?
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: So it's like I never really know what tomorrow is 
going to look like working in a service job. 
There are so many horror stories, especially 
lately, about queer people waiting on someone and 
then getting, like fucking beaten up in the 
parking lot after. So it's like you really have 
no idea.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: A table that you thought you made a really good 
connection with and supported you could just be 
getting information to hate crime you. So like 
you really don't know.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: But I mean. I always have food.
Pingelton: Yeah.
Kettle: And I always have the tables that do appreciate me 
and do treat me well so I can just like hope that 
it continues that way.
Pingelton: Yeah, very, very real opinion. Very a realist 
view of the future from an expert in their field.
Kettle: Yeah.
Pingelton: I think. Do you have any more thoughts? We have 
hit our time limit but. We can go forever.
Kettle: I think I'm pretty thoughtless at this point. 
[laughs]
