Place of Interview: Denton, Texas




Karen Goss: Hello, this is Karen Goss. I am with Brianna 
Sosa and we're going to be conducting a brief 
interview for the Milpa project for the Oral 
History program at the University of North Texas. 
We are in Denton, Texas, and it is Monday, April 
29th, 2024. Welcome, Brianna. Thank you for 
agreeing to do this interview! If you don't mind, 
if you could just tell me a little bit about 
yourself and your connection to food. In 
particular, if there's any family recipes or 
anything like that that you've been collecting or 
anything special that comes to mind when you 
think about food and your family and that kind of 
thing, that would be great.
Brianna Sosa: Yeah. So, I've been in Denton for about 6 
years now, roughly. And before that, I was in 
South Texas for my entire life. I was there quite 
a long time. And I grew up around the Hispanic 
culture and surrounded by it in every sense of 
the word, the language, the food, everything. So, 
my relationship with food I think is tied with 
family and it's extremely linked; it's a part of 
the culture. And, it has a lot to do with, I 
think, what is available in that region. But a 
lot of recipes that I've been trying to learn, 
remember and talk to my grandparents and mom 
about -- some examples are Menudo, Fideo, 
Calabaza con pollo, mole. Yeah, that's just a 
couple of the examples.
Goss: That's awesome. I don't know really anything about 
any of those, so the more you want to tell me, 
the better! We'll get into that a little bit 
further as we get further into our little chat. 
Are there specific recipes amongst those that you 
have memories of either your mom making or your 
grandma making or, as a collective, like your 
whole family making that kind of a thing?
Sosa: Yes. So, with menudo, that's like an overnight 
endeavor. So they start the evening before, and 
they're boiling -- I don't know exactly which 
parts of the animal that they're boiling, but I 
know that it has to be going all night and they 
have to wake up and set alarms to get up and mix 
all this stuff.
Goss: Oh wow.
Sosa: And I remember my mom telling me to go do it at like, 
11, so she could sleep longer. And then she'd be 
up early in the morning, at like 5:00AM, and 
starting it because it's more of, like a 
breakfast thing. So then, like, it's ready by, 
like, 8:00AM to eat. And she normally makes a 
lot. So, we have a lot leftover, and the whole 
family comes and eats some of it. So, that's one 
memory. And then with the entire family, I used 
to make them tamales with my grandma and she 
would kind of lead that. She can't really do it 
anymore because she's a lot older now, but --
Goss: Oh wow.
Sosa: Back when me and my sister were younger, we would 
help her grind the meat in like a manual meat 
grinder. Yeah.
Goss: Is it one that she had had for a long time and like 
had maybe gotten from her grandmother and it was 
just passed down from family member to family 
member? Or is it like a wedding present that she 
got? Or do you know where it came from?
Sosa: I think my mom probably made her upgrade at some 
point. Because she's just very stubborn, like. We 
had to force her to upgrade to a manual like 
Spice Grinder because she would want to do it. In 
the molcajete! Oh my God!  And yeah, we're like, 
no, this is easier. Look, you just push the 
button. There's no manual labor, yeah. She's very 
-- about that manual labor when it comes to food, 
especially because for her, I think that's how 
she shows that she loves you and appreciates you.
Goss: Absolutely.
Sosa: But yeah, so specifically with tamales, we'll be up 
and helping her grind the meat, cook it, and then 
put the masa in the little wrap thingies -- know 
what they're called, but, I guess the husks, the 
little shell that you peel off beforehand. And 
then we fill them with like giant spoons and you 
just fill it and then put the meat, and then 
roll.
Goss: That's so cool. Did that also feed the entire family 
then? Would that be like another event where 
everybody would come over and eat all of 
grandma's food?
Sosa: Yes! Foods involved the whole family -- is going to 
be there -- all of our family, and it's amazing.
Goss: So, from having those experiences in the kitchen, did 
that lead you and your sister to want to cook 
also? Or are you just kind of, more, "we'll make 
it when we have time to make it, but there's all 
these other choices that we have?" Like, what's 
your connection personally to cooking and that 
kind of thing?
Sosa: I think as I got older, I started to realize that not 
everybody had this experience. And I kind of 
realized, oh, these foods are special to me. And 
my culture. So as time went on, I wanted to start 
collecting these recipes and I wanted to be like, 
well, not everybody has a grandma and a mom who 
knows how to do all these things and cook for 20 
people at a time. Like, that's insane. But yeah, 
that definitely, I think it helped to get a 
better understanding of who they are and how why 
they cook the amount that they do and, yeah, all 
of.
Goss: That's amazing. And so, the things that you do cook 
now, are there specific ingredients that are 
different that you find here versus what you were 
able to find when you were still in South Texas 
and a little bit closer to the Mexican border? 
For example, are there specialty shops that you 
go to? Where are you able to find things at the 
more Americanized grocery stores and that kind of 
thing, or how does that work?
Sosa: Yeah. So, I will say things that we would use for 
these commonplace meals that would feed a large 
number of people. I think the resources were 
easier to find back where I'm from, whereas in 
Denton, there you've got to find specific places 
and they might have it. But a good example is me 
and my cousin and my sister made Fideo the other 
night and we couldn't find the vermicelli noodles 
and we had to go with normal pasta to go ahead 
and make it. So that's a good example of that.
Goss: Nice. Can you give a broader description of what 
Fideo is? I'm not familiar with that, and I know 
that's one of your favorites, so I want to have 
you share a little bit like what it actually is, 
when you would eat it, that kind of thing.
Sosa: Yeah. So that's a good -- it's really a soup, if I 
had to classify it as something. But you're 
supposed to roast the noodles, and then make the 
meat, and then put them together. And then boil 
the water with the tomatoes. You can also cook 
the onions with the meat if you wanted to, but I 
think it's better boiled. Some people, I think 
all people do it differently -- yeah, each family 
teaches it differently probably too -- but then 
you put everything all together, and then it's 
like a nice, pleasant soup that is very flavorful 
and good!
Goss: Is it something that you make enough of that you can 
save it and have it for a later meal? Or is it 
something that you would intentionally make 
enough to serve the people that you're inviting 
over to eat? And it's a one-and-done kind of 
thing? Is that another example of something that 
would be made to feed a lot of people, or is that 
something you can make in a smaller batch?
Sosa: I think, when I was younger, I always ate it with a 
lot of people. And now I kind of feel like we've 
had to dial it back because our entire family 
didn't move up here with us to go to college. So, 
dial it back a little bit.
Goss: That makes sense.
Sosa: But yeah, I think back when I lived down there, it 
was for sure for more people.
Goss: When you guys were making it this most recent time, 
were you able to do it based on the recipe that 
you had gotten from your mom? Or were you still, 
like, needing to call your mom or FaceTime your 
mom during the actual cooking to make sure that 
you were doing things the right way?
Sosa: [laughs] Yes, we did have to FaceTime our mom in 
order to make sure we're doing everything 
correctly, because she was -- she's the expert on 
it.
Goss: That's great. Is she like -- what has her reaction 
been to you and your sister reviving this 
excitement of having recipes that you grew up 
with? Is she pleased that you're wanting to carry 
that forward and kind of save that legacy, or is 
it something that she had even thought of before 
that she wanted you guys to do or no?
Sosa: Yeah, I don't think she put a lot of thought into it. 
Especially when she was growing up, they were 
doing these meals in order to survive and make 
ends meet, and it was very stressful when she was 
growing up. But for us it was more like, we like 
this and it's a part of our culture. We want to 
reengage with that because we can't, up here. It 
feels like sometimes, because we're not around 
our family all the time like we used to be -- but 
I feel like she likes it. She likes that we're 
asking her questions, and obviously she's really 
good at making these foods at this point, so I 
think she likes us doing it.
Goss: Is she able to share all of the recipes herself, or 
is she also having to like, call your grandma and 
ask her specific things about "like when I tell 
my girls what I want them to do for this recipe," 
or does she have enough knowledge from all the 
times that she's made it herself that she's just 
passing it on?
Sosa: I think at this point she knows all of it. She was 
the youngest -- nope, sorry, not the youngest, 
the oldest of four, so she was feeding them 
constantly. So she learned as she was doing that, 
so I think she knows pretty ingrained at this 
point. 
Goss: That's amazing! So did your mom also grow up in South 
Texas? Was this area where her family was pretty 
much all the time, or were they moving back and 
forth? What kind of things was your mom doing as 
she was growing up?
Sosa: Growing up, yeah, she grew up in the same exact area 
that I did, obviously different time, but. Yeah, 
occasionally they would go up to Ohio to do 
migrant work -- I think they went every summer. 
Or, yeah, something like that. It was like a 
seasonal thing that they would go up and do.
Goss: With the whole family?
Sosa: Oh, yes. Everybody that's old enough, everybody would 
be working.
Goss: Wow. Do you know at like what age did your mom and 
her siblings, what age were they kind of expected 
or allowed to do work alongside their parents at 
that point?
Sosa: I think it was as soon as they could, or were able to 
pick things. Yeah.
Goss: Was there specific crop that they were moving to Ohio 
to pick, or were there different seasonal things 
that they did?
Sosa: I think it was -- I know that for sure they mentioned 
tomatoes and onions. And I think that's partially 
also why my grandpa knows how to grow these 
things on his own now, and he has a little garden 
in his backyard that he tends to. He's always 
tended to it ever since I was, oh, very young. 
Ever since I was young -- and me and my sister 
used to always go mess up his crops -- not 
intentionally, but yeah. [laughs]
Goss: That's great. So do you think that because they did, 
grow and pick or, were part of that whole process 
with tomatoes and onions in particular, that your 
grandpa is still growing them because those are 
ingredients that they always want to be fresh 
when they're cooking? Has that translated to your 
generation, when you guys are cooking? Are you 
always reaching first for fresh, or are you 
reaching for whichever is most available, whether 
it be fresh or canned?
Sosa: We always try to do fresh. I think probably because 
of him. He'd always have his tomatoes that he 
just picked. He'd have them like, out. And he 
also -- something he would make like every 
weekend or so was chilito. And it's essentially 
just like a spicy sauce type of thing to put on 
your eggs in the morning type of thing. And 
normally our grandma would be making, like 
chorizo, or egg or something along those lines 
sometimes nopales -- those are pretty good! And 
he would -- it was entirely on him to do the 
chilito though, because he did it right -- yeah -
- and he would show me how, he would show me and 
my sister like, oh, here are the Serrano Peppers 
--
Goss: Wow.
Sosa: And he's like, should we do one or two? And we would 
always be like, do 2 Grandpa, it tastes better! 
Yeah. And then it's like, oh, it's spicy -- maybe 
we should have gone with one. [laughs]
Goss: That's awesome! So was he an actual participant with 
other things in the kitchen? Because sometimes 
the roles are very gender defined, especially in 
the kitchen -- so were the tomatoes and and all 
of that like his one thing that he did, or was he 
invited into, I guess, allowed into the kitchen 
for other things too?
Sosa: I think because of the era that my grandmother came 
from, no, he was -- that was pretty much his only 
thing. At least that we saw.
Goss: That makes a lot of sense.
Sosa: Yeah.
Goss: Based on that time frame.
Sosa: Yeah, she was very much like the kitchen is my 
domain. 
Goss: Yes, her domain, "this is mine, I'm doing this." So, 
yeah, okay, that makes a lot of sense -- so is it 
mostly the recipes from their generation that 
were passed on to your mom, that you and your 
sister are most interested in preserving now? Or 
are there things that you think your mom started 
to cook separate from what she learned from her 
parents, that you're also wanting to carry 
forward?
Sosa: I think there's things that my mom cooks less often 
and more often based off of her preferences. UM. 
Yeah, I think. Like a good example is she doesn't 
cook fideo all the time because it's a little 
more unhealthy, or she'll cook less, and boil 
more often, because it is healthier. And that's 
kind of like the way she'll break it up in 
between what she decides to cook. 
Goss: Interesting. Do you guys have a plan yet for what you 
want your collection of recipes to look like? Do 
you envision just a collection on like recipe 
Note cards? Do you want to actually put together 
some kind of a family cookbook where you're 
collecting not just from your mom and your 
grandma, but maybe also from your aunts and some 
of your extended relatives? Or is that something 
that you want to do? A digital archive of recipes 
so that it can be kept forever and ever for 
future generations? Or has your thinking process 
in your collection of the recipes even gone that 
far?
Sosa: The plan right now, I haven't really talked to my 
cousin and my sister about it just yet, but so 
far, we're the only ones who really have shown 
interest out of the grandchildren -- but at least 
the thought right now is to commit it to memory 
by doing, because that's how they learned 
absolutely. So. That's kind of. The thought 
process right now.
Goss: Do you think at some point there will be a written 
record of some sort just so that the oral 
tradition doesn't just get lost somewhere along 
the way if there's not somebody else that picks 
up your same interest and wants to carry it 
forward?
Sosa: If one of us has a child that has zero interest in 
learning that, then yes, I would say yes. 
Goss: In your conversations that you've had over the years, 
like with your mom, especially about the time 
that she did, like, leave her home in South Texas 
and go to Ohio, did she have any specific things 
that she shared with you about like what their 
time was like there, or how different their day-
to-day life was? Working on a farm like that 
versus just normal everyday life when they were 
back home?
Sosa: I know she wasn't a fan of it. I know because she 
told me a couple times that they would have to go 
to the restroom in an outhouse and stuff like 
that. And it was like hard labor. And I remember 
I was wearing converse one time and my grandpa 
was like ohh, Chucks, and I was like, yeah? And 
he was like, I used to wear those when I would 
have to go pick the vegetables in the fields and 
I was like, oh, I did not know that.
Goss: Oh wow, that's interesting. Were there other families 
in the same region where your family came from 
that also went and did migrant work, or was your 
mom and her family singled out for that, like 
were they having similar experiences to other 
kids that she went to school with and that kind 
of thing? Or was she maybe partially like mad 
about it because she was the only one that had to 
leave home for the summer to go do this kind of 
work? Has she talked about that at all?
Sosa: I'm not sure. I do think that it had to have been 
other families because she mentioned like other 
people other than her being there that are also 
Hispanic that I know she mentioned from the area. 
But, I don't know that she, like, resented it. At 
least now she shows no resentment. But that could 
have been different when she, yeah -- younger, 
12. Yeah, for sure. But I know from when she 
talks about that time she was very stressed-well, 
raising her other siblings, her three other 
siblings.
Goss: Yeah. Did she kind of have to take on more of the 
mother role when her parents were doing all the 
farm labor type things? And is that kind of what 
made her more responsible for the cooking, do you 
think?
Sosa: Yes. Absolutely think that. Yeah, I think that she -- 
she was very -- she had to be responsible at a 
very young age for her and her three siblings. 
And making sure that they went to school and did 
what they were supposed to do, make sure they ate 
everything that their mom was supposed to be 
doing, but their mom was busy working -- if that 
makes sense -- and there's not a lot of jobs you 
can get with third grade education, at least, 
well, paying ones -- and then her dad had up to a 
9th grade education also. So they were both 
trying to make ends meet -- just trying to do 
enough work, whatever that ended up looking like 
to make sure the family was fed.
Goss: Did they talk at all about, like, what their meals 
looked like from one place to the other? I would 
imagine if they had to work in the fields for 
long hours every day, there were different time 
constraints on what they could and couldn't make 
that kind of a thing. Were there other things 
that they might have had memories that they 
shared? They're probably not as specific as that, 
but are there things that you remember from 
conversations with them about what eating looked 
like in the two different places?
Sosa: They didn't really mention anything like that, but 
from what I know about them, my assumption is 
they utilized beans a lot. And my grandma knew 
how to make tortillas from scratch, so she'd 
probably set up some sort of situation for them 
to be eating them. 
Goss: Are they corn tortilla eaters, or are they flour 
tortilla eaters? Or will they eat both depending 
on what's available?
Sosa: I think depending on what's available. They weren't 
especially picky back then. I don't think they 
had the means to be picky about what they were 
going to eat. It was going to be what's more 
convenient for the time.
Goss: When your grandmother made the tortillas, what was 
that process like? Did she do that when you 
witnessed it? Like, were you able to, like, 
observe a whole tortilla making process? Can you 
talk about that?
Sosa: Yes, I did help her. I did help her a little bit when 
I was a lot younger and she was actually able to 
do it. Every New Year's, she would make buñuelos 
from scratch, so she'd do the whole tortillas and 
she would like, do the whole, pressing them down, 
flatten them, and then she'd fry them in a pan on 
both sides and me and my sister always laugh at 
this, but when she's making like regular 
tortillas like on the stove, she just grabs them 
with her hand.
Goss: Oh my goodness, just from the practice of having done 
it so many times. She's not afraid of the heat 
anymore. Wow.
Sosa: Yeah. Like she -- [Gestures grabbing tortilla in pan] 
And my mom can do it too. Yeah. I'm like, we 
always joke with them. We're like, is that what 
happens when you become a Hispanic mom, like, you 
just lose feeling in your fingertips and you 
could just grab it? But yeah. We would help her. 
I remember when we were younger and they didn't 
like us being around like the super hot stuff we 
would like, put the sugar in the cinnamon on the 
bundles and stuff like that.
Goss: Wow, you're making me hungry, but I'm really enjoying 
this conversation! So what other things do you 
want to talk about in regards to things that 
you've talked about, you know, with your mom or 
with your grandma? Surrounding the idea of food 
and recipes and family and all of those things?
Sosa: Yeah, we've tried to tell them that we do want to 
keep some sort of record of it all. They're like 
-- they're these hard, chill Hispanic women. 
They're like we'll get in the kitchen and do it. 
That's the type of people they are, so, yeah. So 
I always try to follow that advice to a certain 
degree, but I know that, especially working full 
time -- it's kind of hard to find time for that, 
but we do occasionally.
Goss: You've named a couple of your favorite dishes. Are 
there more?
Sosa: Yeah, there's more -- I know my grandma used to make, 
specifically, she used to make this gravy out of 
nopales and we used to help her like go to the 
backyard with box cutters and we take the spines 
off the paddles. Wow, yeah.
Goss: Oh.
Sosa: That hurt sometimes. But she's kind of like I'm out 
here, I'm 60 years old, you're going to be out 
here too, and you're gonna be doing this!
Goss: Did your grandparents grow up in Texas, or did your 
grandparents grow up in Mexico and then come to 
Texas? Because they probably have different 
memories of food also from their childhoods from 
wherever they grew up.
Sosa: I think they were both already here. Umm. I think 
their parents came over though.
Goss: Okay.
Sosa: Uh. I know for sure on my dad's side, my grandpa -- 
We went and visited him the other day. And he was 
talking about how the water that's near the 
border is not clear anymore, and he was saying 
like he was saying it in Spanish and I don't 
understand Spanish -- it's something I'm working 
on but -- our dad translated it for us and he was 
like, he's talking about like the water was clear 
back then, and it's not anymore.
Goss: Interesting.
Sosa: It kind of makes me sad, but --
Goss: Definitely!
Sosa: Yeah, he's 94. Yeah.
Goss:Wow, yeah. 
Sosa: As many years as -- you've been around for a minute! 
Goss: Save those memories! When you talk to your grandma 
and your mom about food, what does your grandma 
talk about? Like recipes and things like that 
being passed on from her mom or from her grandma? 
Is it something that -- are there things that 
started with your grandma, or are these things 
that she brought forward into her young married 
life because she had learned it growing up also?
Sosa: I think so. I think she had a very traumatic 
childhood, so she doesn't like to talk about it. 
But, from what I understand, yes. I know she did 
have to -- she's the oldest of 12, so --
Goss: So she probably played a similar role that your mom 
did growing up and raising her siblings and that 
kind of thing as well?
Sosa: Extremely similar, yes. Yeah. So. Yeah, it's my 
understanding that she carried on that as well 
and raised her other siblings in a similar way to 
my mom.
Goss: Are the majority of the women in your family, from 
both your grandma's generation and your mom's 
generation -- kind of, did they kind of follow 
the same gender roles? I guess you could say as 
far as the kitchen being their domain versus the 
men in the family? Or have some of them, 
especially as times have changed and they've 
been, you know, in different parts of Texas and 
things like that, are they kind of shifting into 
more, "Yes, I grew up doing all of the things, 
but now I can share more?" Like where are they 
with that?
Sosa: Well, I can tell you where my mom is with that, for 
sure. So my mom got divorced from my dad, I think 
back in 2016. So with her first marriage, she was 
very much carrying that sentiment of the kitchen 
is my domain. This is mine. I do all the things 
here, yada yada. And when she got divorced and 
remarried -- with my stepdad, her now husband, 
she is very much of the idea that this is their 
shared space. They cook together apart, and they 
very much share that role and they yeah, and even 
across all what would be considered "normal" 
women gender roles as far as cleaning and cooking 
and everything they do all of that together and 
apart.
Goss: Knowing that, like if your grandma comes to visit 
your mom, what is your grandma's reaction to your 
mom sharing that now as opposed to how it was 
when she grew up and how she raised her daughter, 
your mom? Is she happy to see that change? Or 
does she kind of roll her eyes at your mom and be 
like you should be doing this? Or like, is there 
-- is that even a thing?
Sosa: I'm not sure that she knows. Since we live so far 
away now, I don't think she knows.
Goss: Okay. Do you think she would be okay with it or do 
you think she would --?
Sosa: I doubt she would be okay with it.
Goss: And that's probably just a cultural thing, right? 
Where it's just the role that they grew up in. So 
this is their comfort kind of a place?
Sosa: She's only not doing it, my grandmother, she's only 
not doing it now because she physically cannot. 
Yeah.
Goss: Because you can't -- makes a lot of sense, yeah.
Sosa: Yep. Yes.
Goss: So what other things do you remember about being in 
the kitchen when you were younger?
Sosa: It was a lot of observing.
Goss: Did your grandma and your mom want you to help? Did 
they want you to learn those kind of traditions? 
Like, were you and Brittany open to that, or were 
you just there to observe and "call me when it's 
ready?"
Sosa: Yes. We. Definitely more of a second one. [laughs] 
When we were younger, we did not really care 
because we thought at the time everybody eats 
like this. Everybody eats these things. We 
weren't -- especially growing up down there, 
everybody's Hispanic, everybody's like -- you 
can't turn a corner and see somebody who's not 
just like you. You go to school, all the kids are 
Hispanic. There might be one or two kids that are 
not, and that's like -- they're the ones that are 
in the minority in a sense, okay? So we're very 
much of the idea that everybody eats these foods. 
And then as we grew up, we were like --
Goss: Maybe they don't.
Sosa: That is not the case. Yeah, that's very much not the 
case.
Goss: Okay. Did you realize that more before you left the 
South Texas area or more when you guys got here 
to Denton in the North Texas area and you're like 
-- this community is a little bit different? 
Obviously not every single person at UNT is 
Hispanic, but we're definitely serving more 
Hispanic students, and there's more in the 
community. So was it something that you were 
starting to realize before you moved here or 
really was it an eye opener when you got here? 
And you're like "Oh!"
Sosa: Yeah, I knew, I definitely knew that. Not every place 
was like the place I grew up. But, seeing it was 
a whole different thing. Yeah. I just feel like, 
and especially like University of North Texas, 
we're a very diverse school. Yeah, for sure. I 
realized there's a lot of different ways of life 
out here.
Goss: Yeah. So it's impressive, and fascinating, to me and 
I feel very honored that you're sharing with me 
that you know, these are things that you grew up 
with that you do want to preserve and keep. Can 
you talk a little bit more about like when you 
realized "Hey, maybe it would be a good idea to 
get some of these recipes from Mom and grandma." 
Sosa: I think especially after my grandma started having 
some health concerns and you, as you grow up, you 
kind of realize, okay, my grandma, my mom, these 
people aren't going to be here forever. And 
that's kind of when -- I was around like 16 years 
old and I was like, okay, these things aren't 
going to stay this way for as long as me and my 
sister and whoever else is alive, we need to 
start curating this and saving it.
Goss: That's amazing. And I know you mentioned at least one 
of your cousins is kind of interested in doing 
some of this too -- are the other grandchildren 
also interested in learning the recipes? Or do 
some of them already know the recipes? Like what 
are the other people in your family's household 
cooking habits that you know of? What do they 
look like? And is it different between folks that 
have, like moved up north like you guys have? 
That sounds weird because you're still in the 
same state, but you know what I'm saying, are 
people that are still, you know, a little bit 
closer to the Texas, Mexico border -- do their 
families cook and commune around food and that 
kind of thing? Is it similar or different?
Sosa: I think, because of the way that they are, that's 
saying something without saying a lot [laughs]. I 
do not think that they carry that same sentiment 
because I think they weren't -- well, first off 
their dad is the one that is part of our family 
so and he didn't really carry that forward like.
Goss: Right. That would have been the women's domain, not 
his domain. So he was more concerned with.
Sosa: Exactly. I think that might have.
Goss: Making money, that kind of thing, rather than 
carrying on a tortilla recipe. Yeah, okay.
Sosa: Been part of. It -- yes. Exactly. Yeah. So I think 
that's kind of why, more than anything. But I 
know at least one of our cousins used to have 
some sort of desire to cook the meals that we 
grew up with. But she has -- she still lives in 
down there in South Texas, but she's not, really 
engaging with the culture at all, pretty much.
Goss: Very interesting. So as you guys start making more 
things and doing more recipes, do you think that 
you'll be able to find the ingredients that you 
want so that they taste like home. Like what's 
your experience with some of the? I think you 
referred to them in another conversation that we 
had as the "meat markets?" Is that kind of a 
thing or is it something that you've noticed 
becoming more mainstream and like our more 
traditional Americanized grocery stores like 
Kroger and whatever else we have in town, like 
Winco? Are you able to find things there, or are 
you needing to go to more specialized places to 
find some of the things that you want so that 
when you do take the time to make these recipes, 
that they'll actually taste like you remember 
them tasting?
Sosa: Yeah, I think, I think it's more convenient to go to 
these specialized places because they're going 
to, you know, they're going to have what you 
need. But I think this most previous time we made 
fideo we got everything from Walmart, so it's not 
like we weren't able to, but it's just more 
convenient to go to these tapatios and La 
Michoacanas -- these places that we know is going 
to have what we need. 
Goss: And you had made a reference to something that you 
and your sister call some of these places. Can 
you talk about that? 
Sosa: Yeah. We like to call them little portals to South 
Texas back where we're from, because it's 
literally like walking into a corner store in 
there. Back where we're from and it they sell all 
the Mexican candies that we like to eat and 
everything like that so --
Goss: I think that's amazing and fascinating! Thinking 
about like your experiences in South Texas with 
food growing up versus your experiences here in 
North Texas with food and resources that are 
available, things that are on menus and 
restaurants that you go to that kind of a thing, 
do you have any kind of just like, in general, 
feel for what food in North Texas over the next 
several years, as our population continues to 
grow more towards a Hispanic majority, what that 
might look like and what kind of resources our 
population, as it changes, might want or demand? 
I know you're not specifically part of the food 
industry, but since you know you're learning to 
cook more things and interested in how to source 
all this stuff like, do you have any thoughts on 
that in general?
Sosa: I mean, I do think since there would be more Hispanic 
individuals in the area that there would be more 
of a want for those outsourced materials that we 
use to cook our most common dishes. I'd imagine 
that they'd be more commonly found in, like 
Walmart and these, like more Kroger like these 
more common places -- I guess supermarkets in the 
area. That would be my assumption. 
Goss: But I think the accessibility of the smaller markets 
like you were talking about -- I think that's so 
unique and special that it would be sad to see 
those either go away or become smaller if things 
became more mainstreamed, because I think even 
just even just your comments about how to how it 
makes you feel like you've, you know, gone into a 
portal back to South Texas -- like -- really 
strong connection to that kind of a place.
Sosa: I think they'd find a way to stick around.
Goss: Are there certain restaurants in town that you have 
found that make some of the dishes that make you 
feel like you're still eating food from South 
Texas growing up, or have things become so Tex 
Mex, Americanized, and, bland, I guess, you can 
find them anywhere on some of the menus? Do you 
seek out places that remind you of home?
Sosa: UM. I enjoy the Tex Mex stuff. I don't have anything 
against it. It's pretty good most of the time. 
But I do find it difficult when I'm a little 
homesick or. However, if I'm not willing to like 
flat out make something. There have been a couple 
of dishes that have come close to like, I think 
probably my favorite food are taquitos from back 
home. Sometimes my family will make those 
ourselves, or we'll go get some from. wherever 
place. Um. And I have yet to find a place that 
makes them exactly like they do back home, and I 
am still on the hunt for that. I've found a 
couple of places that are like decently adjacent 
-- Like I think it's over here on Highway 380 
today. Those are pretty good.
Goss: Good to know.
Sosa: I like the spicy sauce, the red one. That was pretty 
good.
Goss: Would your grandpa approve of the amount of spice 
that they put in? Are they using the appropriate 
amount of peppers? [laughs]
Sosa: I think so. I think so. It's pretty spooky. [laughs]
Goss: So now you said that your grandma doesn't travel here 
much, but do other members of your family from 
South Texas come and visit you guys and like, 
have you had any conversations? Or, not 
necessarily a formal conversation, but just 
casual comments about like whether things here 
taste better, or if I miss, you know, whatever we 
had at home or do you guys know how to make 
whatever that grandma made? That kind of thing?
Sosa: Yeah, we always, they always talk about how it's so 
different over here, so different over there. And 
they're always like, oh, there's all kinds of 
diversity here. And it's like crazy, like they're 
having micro doses of what? The culture. I don't 
want to say culture shock, but to an extent it 
is, but- like, "ohh everybody here doesn't at 
least minutely understand Spanish?" Yeah, it's 
very much a lot of, "Oh, I miss having this 
convenience store that we have over there. That's 
not here." It's a lot of that.
Goss: Okay, that makes sense. And then when you guys go 
visit in South Texas, are there specific foods 
that you crave like I know you want more of your 
grandma's cooking, but are there other places in 
your hometown that you're like, "I have to go get 
Taquitos from a certain place," if it's not the 
ones that grandma made, is there something or are 
there special places that that taste is the thing 
that you have to have?
Sosa: Absolutely. A good example is breakfast food. So like 
here. It's very like "eggs, bacon, pancakes," 
type of thing. And then over there. I'm not 
eating that for breakfast over there. I'm eating 
like full tacos. Like giant ones from like flour 
tortilla type -- yeah, like huge with sauce heat 
on them, a whole lot. And then if I'm not eating 
that I'm eating menudo. I always eat menudo while 
I'm down there because they don't make menudo up 
here the way they do down there.
Goss: Fascinating. So if there was ever, in your realm of 
the world, a way to create either like your own 
home kitchen where you had all of the ingredients 
that you needed and all of the things -- would it 
be something that you would want to carry on 
those same traditions where you're inviting large 
groups of people, whether they all be related by 
family ties or just friend ties so that you could 
still have those big gatherings like you had when 
you were growing up? Or is there enough in the 
North Texas area that you found that you can 
still go to like XYZ restaurant down the street 
and find those similar tastes at least partially 
and that kind of community? Or is the fact that 
it's like your home kitchen the thing that makes 
it special? Does that question even makes sense?
Sosa: Personally I. Don't like cooking for a lot of people 
because that's labor. My mom used to do it so 
often when we were younger and we would have to 
participate in the clean up and the prep for 
everything. So I definitely do not miss that. And 
I wasn't even doing the hard part, so I'm not a 
big fan of cooking for a lot of people and I 
think. I'm good with cooking for me and my 
sister. My cousin. That's enough for me.
Goss: So still a labor of love, just a smaller portion 
going in there -- that makes a lot of sense.
Sosa: Yes, that's work!
Goss: All right. Well, I absolutely appreciate the time 
that you've taken to talk to me about your 
experiences with food, your experiences with 
recipes that have been passed on through your 
family, your thoughts on what food in our area 
looks like versus food in South Texas looks like. 
Is there anything else that you want to add or 
any tidbits that you want to throw in before we? 
Close this conversation.
Sosa: No, I think we covered everything.
Goss: Okay. Well, thank you very much. And if there is 
anything else that you want to add, just let me 
know and I can add it as an addendum to our 
transcript. Thank you!
Sosa: Thank you!
