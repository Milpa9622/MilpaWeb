Rubio Ramiro: Good afternoon. Today I'll be interviewing 
Daisy Mendez for my Latin American Food History 
class. We'll be going over how she comes in 
contact with food on a day-to-day basis, what 
inspired her, and what she's doing now. 
Daisy Mendez: Thank you for having me. I'm excited to 
share my experiences. 
Rubio Ramiro: Today, for our conversation, we'll explore 
Daisy's involvement in food preparation for the 
church community, and her efforts to support 
her family during the pandemic through food. 
Let's start by learning a bit about your 
background and how you got involved in these 
activities. 
Daisy Mendez: I got involved in food preparation through 
the church when I was a kid. Because when I was 
doing my first communion, the church will ask 
for volunteers in the kitchen. On Sundays, my 
mom will volunteer me. And as time grew, I 
enjoyed being a cook and helping prepare food 
for others. 
Rubio Ramiro: Okay, so you started as a child with the 
church, but how about the pandemic? How did 
that come about? 
Mendez: Okay. So for the pandemic, it started out when my 
mom and I, we both decided to cook and prepare 
meals for our family members that were 
quarantined and those that were high risk of 
getting COVID. We didn't want them to spend 
money since some of them did get laid off. So 
we decided to cook and deliver those meals to 
their houses. 
Ramiro: Oh, yeah, I remember you posting about it on 
social media. But before we dive into details, 
can you share with us your passion for cooking 
and what drives you to prepare food for others, 
both within the church and your family?
Mendez: So for passion, I look up to my mom. As a child, 
I remember always helping her cook. And 
preparing food, whether it was a simple dish or 
a dish that require more of an effort. My mom 
will always ask for help and I will always be 
willing to help her out. And for drive. It's 
the happiness and fulfillment that it gives me. 
I love seeing the faces of the churchgoers as 
they receive their plate. And during the 
pandemic, I love seeing my family members happy 
as they receive a homemade dish. 
Ramiro: Um, okay, um, let's start off, let's start off 
with your involvement with the church. Can you 
tell us about your role in preparing food for 
the church?
Mendez: When it comes to preparing food, I go grocery 
shopping during the week for the ingredients, 
as each member of the kitchen is assigned a 
dish. For example, this week I'm in charge of 
tacos, and the salsa, and all the condiments 
that go into making it -- into a taco. So I'll 
go to the grocery store sometime between Monday 
and Friday, and I'll buy the tortillas, the 
meat, the cilantro, the onion, and the 
tomatoes. And all other ingredients that go 
into a taco. 
Ramiro: Okay. So, it's a week long process. But how about 
on Sunday? What time do you get here? How do 
you prepare for it for the day? And about what 
time do you leave? 
Mendez: The time I arrive depends on what I'm making for 
the week. For example, if I had a breakfast 
dish then I would have to be there around 5 
a.m. Because the time it takes to get there, 
prepare the food, and to put everything out, it 
takes about like two hours. Church starts at 7 
a.m. and ends at 8. So, by 8 o'clock everything 
has to be ready to serve the church goers. But 
since this week I have a dish that is not 
breakfast, I will be going in around 10 a.m. 
When I get there, I first prepare the simple 
stuff. For example, I'll start with cutting the 
veggies to make the pico de gallo. Then I will 
prepare the salsa. That usually takes about an 
hour to prepare, and since church doesn't start 
until 12, for the remainder of the time, I help 
serve breakfast. 
Ramiro Okay, so church just ended, and the churchgoers 
are coming out at 1 o'clock. Do you -- when is 
the process you start making tacos? At what 
time? How do you do them? And how does the 
ordering go? 
Mendez: When church finishes at 1, I start to put the 
meat into the griddle at around 12:30. 
Therefore, some of the meat is already ready 
whenever the church goers come out. Once they 
come out, they get into a single file line. 
They tell me how many they want and I'll 
prepare it for them. I do ask them if they want 
onion and cilantro on their taco. As for the 
salsa, we do have a little station area where 
they are able to put the salsa themselves. 
Ramiro: Oh, okay. So one question I do have is. What is 
done with leftover food? Do you guys throw it 
away? Do you guys donate it or do you guys take 
it home?
Mendez: Oh, great question. I do know that we do donate 
the food that is leftover, I don't know the 
process since I've never had the chance to go 
out and donate. But I do know that the higher 
ups go out and give it to the shelters and the 
homeless.
Ramiro: That's cool to hear. Um, I want to ask you, um, 
do you have any favorite recipes or food 
traditions that you've introduced to the 
church?
Mendez: Oh my God! Yes! When I was a kid and I first 
started out here, the only thing that we will 
prepare and make were hot dogs, nachos, hot 
dogs, corn and sandwiches. But as I got older, 
I got accustomed to the place. My friend and I 
decided to go to the higher ups and tell them 
that it would be better if we were to make food 
that people of the Hispanic community would 
eat, especially since the majority of the 
church goers are Hispanics. At first, the 
higher ups were skeptical of the idea, but we 
convinced them. Whenever we decided to start 
selling tacos, as soon as they noticed that 
tacos were a big sell, they came to us with an 
idea to revamp the menu. We decided to keep 
breakfast the same, since, all we made for 
breakfast was egg, sausage, bacon, pancakes, 
and cereal. But for the afternoon lunch, we 
started out with tacos, tortas and gorditas. 
With the tacos and gorditas, you were able to 
pick out if you wanted a single taco or a 
single gordita. Or we also had a meal where you 
would get three tacos or three gorditas with 
rice and beans, and tortillas. And the torta 
came with fries. Now, as we have more people on 
our kitchen staff, we have introduced more 
items. For example, we have introduced pozole, 
enchiladas, Mexican burgers, and quesadillas. 
We did keep nachos and hot dogs and corn for 
the kids, as some kids are picky eaters. We 
have also introduced new drinks like aguas 
frescas with many flavors to choose from.
Ramiro: Has there been a challenge introducing a dish 
onto the menu? 
Mendez: Yes, there are many dishes. However, the only 
ones that come to mind are zacahuil and 
barbacoa. 
Ramiro: For those that don't know, can you tell us what 
zacahuil is? Because I know it's a foreign dish 
that not many of us have heard of. 
Mendez: Yes, of course. I would like to explain further 
as zacahuil was one of my favorite dishes 
growing up. Zacahuil is a dish from the 
Huasteca region of Mexico. I like to say that 
zacahuil is a cousin of tamal. Since it looks 
similar, the big difference of a zacahuil to a 
tamal is that it's very big. I have made a 
zacahuil that are about four feet wide. A 
zacahuil is made in banana leaves, and inside 
you will find chicken, pork, masa, salsa, and 
corn. One of the challenges to making zacahuil 
is that because it is so big, it takes a long 
time to cook. 
Ramiro: Okay, with that being said, can you explain to us 
why barbacoa and zacahuil have been challenging 
when you're trying to bring it onto the menu? 
Mendez: I would love to bring zacahuil into the menu 
because of how unique and rare it is. When I 
make zacahuil and bring it for the kitchen 
staff for them to try it, they always ask me 
that we should add it to the menu. I always 
tell them that I would love to add it to the 
menu, but the challenge is that we don't have 
an oven big enough to cook the zacahuil. And it 
takes a long time to prepare. And if we were to 
add it to the menu, then we will have to cut 
items from the current menu, as it will consume 
way too much time to prep and to cook. As for 
barbacoa, the process of which barbacoa is 
cooked takes a long time as well. And we don't 
have a hole in the ground. I know there are 
ways that we can make barbacoa in a crock pot, 
but I would rather do it old fashioned. Where 
we dig a hole in the ground and smoke the meat 
in the ground as it's covered in maguey leaves. 
Ramiro: Okay with having so much to with having so many 
items on the menu and preparing um food for a 
large group, as it can be challenging can you 
share some of the challenges you faced and the 
most rewarding aspects of this experience? 
Mendez: Feeding 300 people is no small task. It's a labor 
of dedication and logistical planning. Behind 
the scenes of every church event lies, careful 
navigation to ensure that every member is fed. 
First and foremost, among these challenges is a 
scale. When preparing food for such a large 
group, the sheer quantity of ingredients needed 
can be staggering. From pounds of meat to 
gallons of water. Every dish must be multiplied 
to accommodate the hungry people. This requires 
careful planning and coordination to ensure 
that enough food is prepared without excessive 
waste. Yet, quantity is only half the battle. 
Quality is equally important, if not more so. 
Each dish must be prepared with care and 
attention to detail. For many volunteers, this 
means spending hours in the kitchen, shopping 
vegetables, stirring pots, and seasoning 
dishes. It's a labor intense progress, but one 
that is essential for creating a memorable 
dining experience for the people. But preparing 
the food is just the beginning. Serving its 
presence is its own set of challenges. With 300 
hungry mouths to feed, timing is of the 
essence. Volunteers must work together 
seamlessly to ensure that each dish is brought 
out hot and fresh, without long delays or 
bottlenecks. This requires clear communication, 
organization, and a sense of urgency to keep 
things moving smoothly. 
Mendez: Logistics also play a crucial role in the success 
of any church meal. From sourcing ingredients 
to managing budgets, there are countless 
details that must be attended to behind the 
scenes. Volunteers must coordinate shopping 
trips, negotiate with suppliers and keep 
meticulous records to ensure that everything 
stays within budget and on schedule. It's a 
juggling act that requires careful planning and 
attention to detail. Accommodating the diverse 
dietary needs of a large congregation adds an 
extra layer of complicity. From vegetarians to 
gluten free individuals to those with food 
allergies. Volunteers must be prepared to cater 
to a wide range of preferences and 
restrictions. This requires creativity and 
flexibility in menu planning, as well as 
careful labeling and communication to ensure 
that everyone can enjoy the meal safely and 
comfortably.
Mendez: Despite these challenges, the rewards of feeding 
a congregating of 300 people are immeasurable. 
For many volunteers, it's not just about the 
food. It's about the sense of community and 
connection that comes from serving others. To 
sum it all up, preparing and serving food for a 
congregation of 300 at a church is no small 
feat. It requires dedication, organization, and 
a deep sense of community spirit. Yet, it is 
through these challenges that volunteers find 
fulfillment and purpose knowing that they are 
making a meaningful difference in the lives of 
others. As long as there are hungry souls to 
feed, there will always be volunteers ready to 
rise to the occasion, armed with pots, pans, 
and an abundance of love.
Ramiro: You talk about meeting the dietary need of 
others. Can you elaborate on that and how you 
incorporate that onto the menu? 
Mendez: Accommodating dietary needs starts with careful 
planning and communication. Church organizers 
often reach out to members to gather 
information about their dietary restrictions. 
Whether they may be vegetarians, vegans, to 
certain foods. This step ensures that everyone 
feels valued and included in the communal 
dining experience. Once dietary preferences are 
gathered, the next step is crafting a menu that 
balances variety and accessibility. Vegetarians 
and vegan options are incorporated seamlessly 
into a meal plan.
Mendez: In addition to catering, To specify dietary 
needs, church organizers prioritize food safety 
and allergen awareness. Dishes are labeled 
clearly to indicate any potential allergens, 
and precautions are taken to prevent cross 
contamination during preparation and serving. 
This extra level of care ensures that everyone 
can enjoy the meal without worry or discomfort. 
Fostering a sense of belonging and unity among 
all members of the congregation. Some of the 
dishes that we offer that meet others dietary 
needs are vegetarian tacos, which include corn 
or flour tortillas with grilled vegetables such 
as bell peppers, onions, zucchini, and 
mushrooms, topped with salsa, guacamole, and 
cilantro for a flavorful taco experience. A 
bean burrito that comes in a warm tortilla 
around a filling of seasoned black beans, rice, 
lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado. One dish that 
we are about to introduce is a vegan tamale, 
which will have a filling of seasoned 
vegetables, such as squash, carrots and 
potatoes. Oh, yeah. I also forgot we also offer 
fruit!
Ramiro: I am aware that the church that you attend has a 
annual celebration Where it's once a year you 
guys pull up a bunch of tents with food. Can 
you explain the process of that? How does. How 
do you guys distribute food? How is the day? 
How, how do you prepare for that pretty much 
because I'm pretty sure it's a it's a difficult 
day?
Mendez: Oh yeah. The week leading up to the festival is a 
very stressful, as I have prepared more for 
more than 300 people as people from the 
community, regardless of religion come to the 
festival. I will buy all the ingredients at the 
grocery store on Monday, and then the very next 
day is when I start to prepare the zacahuil. 
For the festival, I usually make one chicken 
and one pork. On Wednesday, I will start to 
build a shape of zacahuil. I use about six to 
seven pounds of banana leaf to make the shape 
of the zacahuil. On Friday, I will start to 
marinate the chicken and pork in a homemade 
sauce. And then on Sunday morning At 5 a.m. I 
will start to get everything into the banana 
leaf. As I start to build the zacahuil, I 
preheat the ovens as they can take up to a day 
to cook, depending on the size. As the zacahuil 
cooks, I start to prepare the pozole and the 
desserts. On Sunday morning at 6, I wake up to 
bake the brownies and start to make the pozole. 
And that usually takes around 2 hours. 
Ramiro: Oh, wow. Um, do you do this alone or do you have 
someone else help you? Because doing this all 
looks like it's a very, very challenging day or 
week. 
Mendez: Oh, yes. I do receive help. My mom and friends 
help me out. They usually help me prepare and 
move things around. For example, my mom helps 
me when preparing the zacahuil. She will help 
me add the masa, meat, and other ingredients 
into zacahuil. And my friend helps me move the 
food to the church. They're both very helpful. 
Mendez: Oh, okay. No, that's really good that you get 
help. Uh, but let's go back to the festival. 
You told us how you prepare the food, but tell 
us about the actual day of selling the food. 
Mendez: Oh yeah, so on Sunday, I go over to my station at 
around 10 a.m. and start to get the condiments 
ready. Once the church is done, the festival 
officially begins and we sell the food. The 
festival will last all day or until I run out 
of food. 
Ramiro: I have personally been involved in the festival 
as well, so I know how hectic it gets. I do 
want to transition and move on to the second 
part of our interview. I want to talk about 
COVID and how you cooked food for your family 
when they were in quarantine. I want to ask, 
with the pandemic bringing so many challenges 
to everyone, how did you adapt your food 
preparation practices to ensure safety to your 
family during that time? 
Mendez: Yes, well, just FYI. I mean, for your 
information. Even though, before COVID, I 
washed my hands and cleaned all the surfaces. 
But when COVID happened, I washed everything. I 
became a clean freak. I was so scared that we 
were going to get sick. But a couple of things 
that I did change up was that before and after 
handling food, I will wash my hands and clean 
the surface where I was cooking. Another thing 
that was clean was the fruits and veggies. I 
cleaned the veggies and fruit when I bought 
them, and when I was about to use them.
Ramiro: Okay, with you teaching up how you clean the 
food, I want to ask about shopping for 
groceries during a pandemic. During the 
pandemic, when stores closed down, how did your 
shopping habits change? 
Mendez: When the pandemic hit and the stores started to 
close down or they had limited hours, my 
grocery shopping changed so much. Before the 
pandemic, I could go to the store whenever I 
wanted. But when COVID hit, everything changed. 
I had a specific day when I went shopping to 
avoid crowded stores. Instead of going whenever 
I wanted to the grocery store, I bought stuff 
in bulk. So I won't have to go every other day 
to the store. I also bought canned foods that 
lasted longer. Sam's was my go-to store. 
Ramiro: I want to ask about online shopping. The 
pandemic, online shopping. During the pandemic, 
online shopping increased as stores implemented 
adjusted schedules. For example, I did most of 
my grocery shopping online. Did you also use 
online shopping? 
Mendez: Yes, I did use online shopping for my groceries. 
I mainly use online shopping when there is a 
high risk of people being at the store. I did 
not want to get sick, like I am right now. So 
online shopping helped me out a lot. 
Ramiro: Was there any negatives in online shopping? 
Because I had a couple, like for example, it 
was um, it got busy real, it got busy because a 
lot of people used online shopping. It was 
expensive. And, and sometimes they, uh, and 
they didn't, uh, grab the correct products. 
Mendez: Yes, of course. I remember one time I ordered 
fresh fruit and vegetables from a grocery store 
through the online feature. And when I went to 
go, and pick up my order, the person that 
picked out the fruits and vegetables picked out 
the most beaten and old fruits and vegetables. 
So from then on, I physically bought the fruits 
and vegetables and ordered, canned goods and 
food that does not have to be hand-picked. 
Ramiro: Yeah, I had that issue as well over here, but 
okay, so we did talk about how during the 
pandemic your cleaning habits were adjusted to 
the point where you cleaned everything all the 
time. And how you used online shopping to help 
you out, how you bought in bulk and all that. 
Now I want to talk, now I want to talk about 
the food you made and how you handled that. 
Mendez: Okay, so when COVID, COVID hit and many of my 
family members had to be quarantined. Since 
they could not leave their house and wouldn't 
be able to get groceries for food, I decided 
that I will cook for them so they wouldn't have 
to go out every day.
Ramiro: Did you cook for them every day? Mm hmm. 
Mendez: No, I cooked for them probably about two or three 
times in a week. 
Ramiro: Oh, okay. So what, like what, what was a meal 
that you cook for them for like -- how many 
times and like how often? 
Mendez: So throughout the pandemic, I will cook for them 
many Mexican dishes. Some dishes that I cook 
for them were rice, chicken in mole sauce and 
beans, chiles relleno, tamales, tortas, 
quesadillas, caldo de res, enchiladas, and 
flautas.
Ramiro: Oh, oh, oh wow, um, you were busy during the 
pandemic. I want to ask how you delivered it to 
them with them being isolated. 
Mendez: When delivering food to my family, I felt like a 
door dasher because I would leave the food in 
front of the door and then leave.
Ramiro: I do want to ask, what lessons have you learned 
from your experience, your experience during 
the pandemic, both in terms of food preparation 
and supporting your family? 
Mendez: Certainly, as a cook who prepared homemade meals 
for my family during the pandemic, I've learned 
several valuable lessons that have shaped my 
approach to food preparation and supporting my 
loved ones. First and foremost, I've learned 
the importance of [stutters] a, of a, oh my 
god, I am so sorry about that. Adaptability and 
flexibility. The pandemic brought so many 
challenges from supply chain distribution to 
change, to changing of safety guidelines. It 
taught me to roll with the punches and five, 
create solutions, and challenges as they arose, 
whether they were substituting, or our meal 
plans. And what was available at the store 
being adaptable became crucial and assuring 
that my family needs were met. Secondly, I've 
gained a deeper appreciation for the power of 
cooking with dining out and social gathering 
limited. Our kitchens became a focus point and 
cooking became not a chore but a source of 
comfort. Sharing homemade meals with my family 
became a ritual. They brought us back together. 
Even though they were isolated, the pandemic 
brought the importance of being prepared and 
resourceful. Stocking up on pantry and pantry 
items. Learning how to stretch ingredients and 
making the most of leftovers became an 
essential skill by being mindful of food waste 
and maximizing the use of every ingredient. I 
was able to ensure that we always had 
nutritious meals on the table. Overall, my 
experiences during the pandemic have told me 
the importance of adaptability, the value of 
home cooking and being prepared.
Mendez: These lessons have not only shaped my approach to 
food preparation, but I have also deep in mind 
standing of what it means to support and care 
for my family during these times. 
Ramiro: Oh, yeah. No, I agree with you. I do believe that 
the pandemic definitely brought so many 
challenges when it comes to food preparation 
and supply chain distribution. And I also do 
agree with you as well, whenever you were 
talking about how, um, it brought families 
together. Because not like, for example, before 
the pandemic, my family and I, we would, we 
wouldn't really have dinner together. We'd 
usually do our own separate meals, but once the 
pandemic hit and fast-food restaurants closed 
down Um, we started to have dinner together. We 
cooked homemade meals stayed at home and pretty 
much became a better family. I want to say. But 
I do want to go on and ask another question. I 
think it's going to be one of the final 
questions I'm gonna ask today Which is let's 
see. As we move forward, what are your plans 
for continuing to support your family and 
community through food?
Mendez: Okay, for the community aspects of it, I'm still 
at the church cooking food on Sundays. Although 
I have taken a step back in the role at the 
church since my friend and I have started. I 
want to say like a little local food business, 
business. So pretty much we promote our dishes 
online and people are able to place an order on 
the meals that we cook, which are mostly 
Mexican dishes. And for my family, I still cook 
meals for my close family like mom, dad, and 
even siblings. But for my extended family, I 
stopped making meals when the pandemic ended, 
since it's expensive and it's time consuming.
Ramiro: Okay, that's, uh, that's nice. Um, I do want to 
ask one final question, which is a, uh, 
question that we have to ask. It's, um, how do 
you see food in North Texas as in the 
accessibility to it? 
Mendez: Okay, for the accessibility of food in North 
Texas, I believe it all depends in how you want 
to look at it. For example, we do have a lot of 
grocery stores nearby, so going and actually 
grabbing the food is real easy. But as for the 
accessibility, as in being affordable, it all, 
it all depends on where you're coming from. I 
do understand some people cannot afford to buy 
healthy food here in Texas, as prices here have 
been going up. But there are, there are stores 
where they sell at a low price, like Aldi, 
which is a really great store, that a lot of 
people should go to. But there is also a great 
discrimination of grocery stores here in 
Dallas, for example. And in the parts of the 
city where it's a low-income community, you'll 
see more corner stores where they sell like 
cheap food and frozen food. And in the higher 
areas, you see more of Whole Foods, Target, and 
Sprouts. Well, you'll see more of the healthier 
options. So, there are things that Dallas needs 
to work on.
Ramiro: No, yeah, I do agree with you with the um, the 
great discrimination here in Dallas, I, coming 
from a low-income community, I did see a lot of 
corner stores and how they'd sell frozen foods 
and cheap foods. And now that we were able to 
move into a more upper-middle-class, middle-
class community, um, I see more of a Whole 
Foods, Sprouts, where there are healthier 
options. But I do believe that Dallas as a 
whole needs to be able to have grocery stores 
in low-income communities to sell food for 
cheap, whether, and it has to be healthy as 
well. And I think with that being said, I want 
to thank you for coming and having this 
interview with me. I really enjoyed talking to 
you, whether it was about you telling us about 
your church involvement and how you dealt with 
that, which was amazing. How you fixed the menu 
up and pretty much, in my opinion, rebuilt that 
whole church. And also, I loved talking to you 
about how you've pretty much fed your family 
during the pandemic, and how you worked through 
it, and how you learned a lot. I just, uh, I 
want to thank you for that. 
Mendez: Oh, okay. Thank you. I enjoyed having this 
conversation with you today.
