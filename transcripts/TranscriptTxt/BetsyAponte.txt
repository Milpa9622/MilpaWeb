Francisco Mendez: Hello, this is Francisco Mendez, for the 
final project of Latin American History foods and 
I'm here with Betsy Aponte and I'm going to be 
interviewing her. So, can you tell me a 
little? About yourself. Hi. Good morning. 
Betsy Aponte: Hi. Good morning. Yes, my name is Betsy 
Aponte. I am from Puerto Rico. I am 53 years old, 
and I've been living in Fort Worth, Texas for the 
last 10 years prior to moving to Texas. I've 
lived in Puerto Rico all my life and my first 
language, as you can tell by my accent, it's not 
English, it's Spanish. 
Francisco Mendez: OK, so, what was your primary background 
with food? How did you get into food? 
Betsy Aponte: Food, it's something that is my love language 
and. I started cooking very early in my life, 
probably by the time that I was seven or eight, I 
was doing prep work with my mother. We -- I have 
very humble beginnings and part of my upbringing 
was to do chores in in the house, I have an older 
sister. I am the second sibling on a family of 
four. But. We were kind in two batches, my older 
sister and me were the big girls, quote-un-quote. 
And they're -- it's a six year lap gap. And then 
there were my other two siblings, which are six 
and eight years younger than myself. So, my mom 
kind of tasks us with taking care of them, and 
that included preparing their meals. So, my older 
sister was in charge of my younger sister, and I 
was in charge of my younger brother, so since the 
time that he was two, I recall or even earlier. 
Maybe I was in charge of preparing his milk, 
preparing something for to eat in the mornings, 
and then when he went to kindergarten. It was my 
whole responsibility to prepare his food for 
school, so I've been in the kitchen since very, 
very early on in my life. 
Mendez: OK, so you said that cooking was your love language 
and you've been in the kitchen for your on in 
your life. So, what exactly take -- led you to 
take up cooking? 
Aponte: Well, I think that as part of this childhood 
background, my older sister. She didn't want to 
do anything with the kitchen. But my mom very, I 
mean, we were supposed to either clean the house 
or cook, so I didn't like to mop and sweep and do 
beds. So, we kind of split so she will do the 
cleaning, and I will do the cooking so. Very 
earlier on, I enjoy it. And I think that it was 
the fact that there is some instant gratification 
when you prepare a good meal, which is that the 
people that you serve it to, they will, I mean, 
give you feedback. OK. This is good or this is 
awesome or, yeah, well, it's bad. You have to 
improve for the second time. So, if you get those 
cues, you will instantly be able to prepare 
something that your family likes. And when 
everybody, I mean, sits and eat and the food is 
good, at least there is some good energy and 
probably I kind of got that message earlier on. 
So, it became part of me as a person to try to 
cook for people not to only satisfy their hunger, 
but to kind of express my love and my care like. 
Try to cater to what they want, and you know, as 
I grew up and as I raised my own family and. It I 
had the means to be more, I mean to pamper my 
kids and to pamper my husband and. And since I 
like to cook, it doesn't matter. Whenever I had 
the time, I was going to cook whatever they want. 
So, it was kind of my way of showing them my 
love. 
Mendez: OK. What made you cook primarily Hispanic food and 
not other types of food? 
Aponte: Well, of course, that was I what I was raised with. 
But I have to say it's I. I have evolved in my 
cooking and my menus and what I'm able to cook 
very well. Cause growing up and probably my early 
years, I will cook mostly Puerto Rican. And Latin 
staples, rice, beans, a lot of beef stews, a lot 
of plantain in all different shapes and form. I 
will do like fried plantains or mofongo or 
whatever we cook as 
our regular day-to-day staples, but as I -- I'm through my 
work, I was able to start going into work 
assignment to different countries and that 
actually opened like this whole world of what 
actually. The potential of flavors and meals and 
different things that you can cook, I consider 
myself more a cook than a Baker, but I can bake 
several good dishes. Baking is more of a science 
cook for me it's more of a creative. A method or 
a creative avenue. So, I was able to go to Europe 
to I started in. I first probably trip was to the 
UK outside going several places in the US, so you 
start thinking different things, different 
ingredients. I went to France and I and then I 
started since I was really into cooking one of my 
mandatory non tourist touristic destinations, for 
me it's always go to a local supermarket. I 
really want to know whenever I go to a new place 
what the people cook with and what are the things 
that are normal. to them that I really are 
probably not familiar with and trying to learn 
what you do with that ingredient. So again, I had 
the opportunity 10 years ago to come to the US 
and work in in a company that was doing. A global 
project, so in eight years I was able to go not 
only to Europe like France and Czech Republic, 
and I don't know many other places with within 
Europe, Switzerland, Italy, Germany. But also, I 
was able to get into some Asian countries, so I 
was able to go to Japan and Singapore and every 
single time and I went. There and for example in 
Singapore, they have like a little India. And 
also, I had a I got influences from India from 
many of my coworkers. So, you start sharing food, 
you Start learning that some of the same 
ingredients that you try at home are tried in 
other places. In the world, but with a whole 
different twist. I mean, in a whole deep 
different profile of flavors. For example, in 
Puerto Rico, we'll use tamarind and we will do -- 
we will do maybe like some use the pulp for 
having a drink, very refreshing drink and summer 
time. But if you -- If you look into Asia, like 
my Indian colleagues will have tamarind like for 
chutney or for dipping sauce. So, it's the same 
ingredient. But some people use it for completely 
different things. So, if you are willing to learn 
and kind of have open minded because in my mind 
doing something that I will usually use for 
something sweet. Using it on a savory dish. 
That's the whole complete ball game and then -- 
Even when I started going to these places in, in 
addition to go to a supermarket, if I was to able 
to get some exposure to some culinary lessons or 
culinary experiences, including cooking lessons, 
well, I will try to do so and. I will try to 
bring my family whenever it was possible and 
engage them in that. So that is how from cooking 
like my favorite Latin foods, I was able to get 
into other types of food trying different 
ingredients and. Today I will say that in my 
household today. We can cut anything from Latin 
to French to Asian and everybody kinds of have 
their preferences, but from the exposure point of 
view, I think that we can appreciate that the 
flavors of different cultures are really, really 
good and interesting and with cooking you can 
turn like a single time to eat into a family 
experience. If you get people around the kitchen, 
if everybody pitches in and try to collaborate 
when we are cooking well, that is always awesome. 
Nobody wants to do the dishes. But still the 
experience I think that I love having that my in 
household. 
Mendez: OK. You said you liked exploring in different 
countries and they're like spices and their 
supermarkets. Which one was your favorite 
country, or which one surprised you the most or 
one of each? 
Aponte: Well, I think. I think that in terms of surprising 
anywhere that -- I went to Slovenia and -- The 
food is amazing, but when you go to a super, they 
first they don't have like this big supermarkets 
that we are using in the US or anybody that it's 
like Puerto Rico we have like this big, even 
super simple supermarket. You will have half a 
variety of cereal or a lot of. That kind of food 
in in most of the countries, whether it's a small 
town or even a big city, you will have different 
type of supermarkets, but the level of processed 
foods is not the same. You will get more like 
fresh ingredients than what we get here 
particularly, I was mentioning this place in 
Slovenia in in Slovenia, because there was very 
little box things we were in Kranjska Gora, which 
is a town outside of Ljubljana, which is the 
capital and or one of the bigger cities and there 
were like two small places where you will get 
your groceries and everything was like --
Mendez: All right, we're back. Small interruption. Go 
ahead. 
Aponte: So, I was speaking about the two places in Kranjska 
Gora where you can get your groceries and 
everything was like, very fresh, a lot of 
produce, very little or no packed goods. Well, 
they had like packed goods but not like cereals, 
like brand cereals, they will have everything 
like in small bags of -- you will see the 
oatmeal, but you will not see like frosted flakes 
or things like that. And a lot of fruit. And they 
had like meat, the meats were probably even 
though the currency, it's less expensive there, 
the cost of the meat? The proteins are a little 
bit higher, but everything seems so fresh and 
local, so that for me was kind of a big surprise 
in terms of countries or flavors that I really -- 
I was also surprised on the flavor profile. I 
think that I will have to say Indian food because 
I was surprised on the fact that there are so 
many ingredients that we share in common and the 
other thing that was surprising for me is that I 
wasn't aware that so many ingredients that we use 
in Puerto Rican cuisine are also used in some 
Asian like Vietnamese and Asian foods, so 
sometimes that was very surprising for me. 
Mendez: OK. Going back to Hispanic food, what sets Hispanic 
foods apart from other cuisines like Asian 
cuisine or let's say, Mediterranean cuisine? And 
do you think they share a lot of similarities? Or 
do you think they're more apart than they are 
similar? 
Aponte: Well, I would like to probably categorize my 
understanding of Latin food. Latin food is not a 
one-size-fits-all. I mean Latin what we call 
Latin America, it's a big, big region of the 
world and I can probably speak about Puerto Rican 
food, but even within the Caribbean, the Puerto 
Rican food, Dominican food, Jamaican food, they 
are completely different in Puerto Rico. We do, 
and even with the same ingredients in Puerto Rico 
we do a lot of plantains, and we use mofongo, 
which is smashed plantains with a garlicky flavor 
profile. In Santo Domingo or the Dominican 
Republic, which is the nearby neighbor island, 
they do Mangu, which is also smashed plantains, 
but theirs are boiled, ours are flat fried. 
There's more like a vinegar profile into it. We 
don't do that, so. Latin America, if there is 
something that I will like to leave this message 
or convey a message, is that Latin American food 
is not one thing. Caribbean food is one -- it has 
some ingredients and similar or similarities in 
their flavor profile, but I cannot compare that 
with Mexico because in Puerto Rico we don't do 
spicy food. There are regions of Mexico that they 
do really spicy food and some other regions that 
they don't. In Jamaica, we always think about 
Jamaican jerky or jerk flavors. They are spicy, 
but they are a lot of pepper based. And in Mexico 
you will get like more chili base. You go to 
South America, Chilean, Chilean food. They don't 
have a lot of spices to them, or as spicy as 
heat, they do a lot of -- they have their spice 
profile and then you go to Argentina, and they 
have no spices at all. They all have their 
different flavors and so it's hard for me to 
answer what sets Latin American food apart 
because it's not a monolithic kind of flavor 
profile, right? I can tell you about Puerto Rico 
and the Caribbean, and I can say I'm biased. So, 
what sets Puerto Rican food apart if you are not 
desperate in the need of heat in your food, which 
you can always put, it's the -- Many cultures 
have the same Trinity. When you start cooking, 
you start with either a French mirepoix, which is 
the celery, carrots, and onions. Then you -- and 
that you can change one or two ingredients and 
almost every culture have the same base. Ours in 
Puerto Rico will be peppers, onions, and garlic. 
That is what we use to prepare more -- most of 
our, anything that is stew, that is what we start 
with and a little bit of oil and vinegar, and 
that is going to be our similar sofrito. Which 
Italians have their one, everybody has their own 
thing. Ours has a little bit, not very heat. It 
has a good base of acidity, or a balance of 
acidity, and also has depths in spices. We, in 
addition to those three, will have oregano, we 
will have coriander leaves. We will have a lot of 
ingredients only for the base sofrito that we 
have that will give that particular taste. The 
other important thing about Puerto Rican food is 
that we have a tradition that comes from three 
big influences. Puerto Rico was a colony -- or 
was discovered in Spain in the 1400s, and there 
were some local inhabitants which they had like 
roots, and they will have cassava which was one 
of their main roots and tropical plants. The 
Spaniards came with their own European influences 
and then with the African slaves they also 
brought their influences are there and their 
flavors, so we have a foundation of three very 
distinct cuisines when we --
Aponte: So, with these three distinct cuisines, which are 
the Spaniards, the Africans, and the local 
indigenous inhabitants. We had three different 
distinct flavor profiles and that became the 
foundation of our cuisine. So, in our cuisine we 
were also -- We have rice, we have beans, we have 
cassavas, a lot of root vegetables that like taro 
and the conditions of our very early colonial 
stages set the tone, so we will start putting 
more herbs and spices that were local into our 
cuisine and that actually gives our very 
distinctive flavors. We also had a very good, the 
terrain in Puerto Rico, we have hills and 
mountains, and we had very good agriculture when 
we started in the 1500s and 1600s and then we had 
a lot of sugar cane. So that also had local sugar 
that will help people develop more and more, not 
only sugar-based cooking but also rum and some of 
all those elements create very good food. We had 
very good raw materials available and the 
creativity of that comes from three different 
distinct cuisines and that, kind of, is the 
foundation for what we enjoy today. And then we 
also got the US influence and when Puerto Rico 
was colonized by the US in the beginning of 
1900s. Then we added this additional influence, 
so it also enhanced the whole cuisine. So, Puerto 
Rico has more than rice, beans, and plantains. 
You will get like high end cooking, we had a lot 
of fusion with not only Latin, or if you go to 
old San Juan in you will get restaurants of any 
given kind and with local flair to it. Or people 
that will do, they're very pure French, Asian, 
whatever kind of food you want. So, it's always 
good to be able to have your pure Puerto Rican 
food. It's awesome, it's good and it's comfort 
food, and it can be comfort food elevated as 
well. 
Mendez: All right. You said there are three main types of 
food that came into Puerto Rico. We had the 
African, the Taino, and then the Spaniard. Out of 
the three, which one do you think is more 
prominent? And if you think they're all equally 
as prominent, can you explain why? 
Aponte: I think that the least that is still, as of today 
probably, is the Taínos because unfortunately 
during the colonization they were kind of, I mean 
they were... 
Mendez: Genocided?
Aponte: Exactly. So, there is -- some of their initial food 
which was cassava based and some of the local 
herbs, it was a very rustic kind of food. So, we 
still eat a lot of cassava, but we don't have a 
lot of historical reference on how they will eat 
it, and the couple of ways that they will eat it, 
they were -- we can do it, but it's not as 
flavorful as comparing. Of course, the Spanish 
and the African influence -- we can still see it 
on some of our dishes, but we are talking about 
over 600 years of history, so we can trace back 
some of our food and our cooking methods to 
either Spain or African influences, but it's the 
Creole that all those cultures gave birth to that 
gives birth to the Latin cuisine, and in this 
case Puerto Rican cuisine. If you ask me which 
one, I think that it's more prominent, I will 
have to say that it will be the Spanish one and 
that is on what we call like Puerto Rican food. 
If you go to Puerto Rico today, there's still a 
lot of influence from everywhere in the US so I 
will not call a hamburger Puerto Rican food by 
any means or a hot dog or a pizza, but you can 
get them anywhere and everywhere. But that is not 
what I will call like, something that is part of 
my cultural example of what is a Puerto Rican 
food. 
Mendez: All right. So, you said culturally, the United 
States and Puerto Rico did some exchanges. I 
would like to hear about what exchange Puerto 
Rico had on the US like the most pivotal or like 
the most outshining one, the one that you see the 
most. And then on the other side, what US 
cultural device or food or anything like that 
shined in Puerto Rico?
Aponte: Wow, that is a big question. The US is a very big 
place. OK, so I cannot say that there is a Puerto 
Rican influence on the in the US. I know that I 
can, and I will not attribute it to Puerto Rico. 
But a lot of places where you have a lot of Cuban 
and -- You have Cuban and Puerto Rican influences 
locally. You will find people eating. Cuban 
sandwiches and you will have them eat drinking 
mojitos. The Pina Colada was invented in Puerto 
Rico, that is. I think that if you are going to 
say the single most Puerto Rican thing that it's 
no all over the US will be the pinnacle in terms 
of food, I think that the prominence of the 
plantain has to do not with Puerto Rico, but with 
its consumption, and I think that Latin culture. 
So whenever you find a place where Latin 
population is served, you will very likely find 
things like plantains and local fruits, and that 
is what I can say that from that from the US, I 
have to say that everything that it's like fast 
foods are things that are very prominent 
prevalent in Puerto Rico that will come from the 
US and it's like our they, I mean they became 
part of our day-to-day in terms of. I'm trying to 
think what it's hard for me to say, OK, what is 
the main typical dish of the US? Because you 
don't have one. You have one per region. We 
don't. We do grilling. We don't do smoking as 
much, but we do grilling is. That the 4th of July 
typical grill of hamburgers and hot dogs. We do 
that on 4th of July too. I don't know if I 
answered your question, but at least they there 
are some influences that are there. We have to 
understand also that Puerto Rico, its territory 
has been a territory of the United States for 
more than 100 years. So, there are some things 
that are already part of our culture just because 
of the political relationship and food wise as 
many as the ingredients that come from the US 
have become more and more available. That has an 
impact on what you eat. So. 
Mendez: OK, so back to foods and ingredients, I want to 
ask. Primarily in Puerto Rico, where do you where 
and what did you source when you were cooking 
Hispanic type food and then visa versa in the US? 
Did you find it harder to find those same 
ingredients, or did you find them just as 
easily? 
Aponte: Mmmm. OK. In Puerto Rico, of course, I will go to 
the local supermarket. And I mean, and when my 
grandpa was alive, he will have like a big 
lettuce kind of he will have. It's a local garden 
and he will have a lot of lettuce and he will 
have like plantains and bananas and so that will 
come from my very local grandfather's backyard 
and my father had also some plantains and bananas 
because it's a tropical weather so you can grow 
your peppers and your small fruits like in your 
backyard every 360 days a year and a lot of 
people will have if they have space and they 
live. On a non-urbanized area that you will have 
at least 1/4 of an acre you will something will 
grow. And actually, my in-laws, they all had a 
mango tree on their house, and they had some 
coriander leaves, so they will have also their 
small. Fruits and vegetables that they can grow 
and so it was local. Of course you will get from 
your parents or your people that you know and 
your neighbors, if they had a excess of 
plantains, they will share, so that was very 
normal when I came here to the States and it took 
me a while to figure out and but I was I didn't 
lack of many of the ingredients I just have to 
look where to get them to my surprise and most of 
the things that were like very I was able to get 
everything, all my seasonings, my gorgeous stuff. 
I was going to. I will get them in, in, in 
Walmart. I mean it's not that I need to go to a 
specialty supermarket. They are all. And even in 
Kroger they had like an aisle of international 
foods, and I will get some of the seasons, things 
that I struggle with were like the roots, like 
the taro roots cassava roots go get those and the 
coriander leaves. Some of those things, and I end 
up finding them either in Mexican restaurants 
like Fiesta. But to my surprise. It was the Asian 
supermarkets which had most of the specific 
things that I wanted, like I mentioned, like Taro 
root, cassava root, malanga roots, those kind of 
things. They were nowhere to be found in like the 
regular supermarkets, but they were fresh and 
plentiful in in Asian supermarkets. So as soon as 
I was able to identify where to get those, I will 
just go there and get. As of today, I can't say 
that I really need any ingredient, and I can even 
sometimes find the brands that I used in Puerto 
Rico. So, if I there are several Walmarts nearby, 
that will bring Arroz Rico, which is one that I 
used to. It's. Puerto Rican brand of rice. Not 
every Walmart has it, but there are a lot of 
Walmarts that bring them. So, when I find that, I 
just. Pour them and rice will not go bad, so you 
look to my pantry today I have like 60 pounds of 
rice, and they will probably not last that long 
because my family can eat rice so. I mean I am 
lucky that I have my cooking has not suffered or 
at least not because of a lack of ingredients. 
Mendez: I want to take you back to the part of Community 
you said back when we were talking about Puerto 
Rican ingredients, how you sourced them, that you 
had them from your parents. Grandparents, your 
neighbors, your in-laws, all that. How do you 
feel that community has changed or the way people 
look at community in the states versus in Puerto 
Rico? Because I saw some like in the United 
States when you said you want ingredients, you 
said I get them from the grocery store, 
supermarket, but in Puerto Rico you said, oh, 
yeah, I have the supermarket, but. 
Aponte: Mhm. As well, we have we grow them, and we exchange 
them, and we have them all together. Well, 
yeah. In my personal case it's different because 
of course I grew there, my family and extended 
family was there. I don't have that here, so for 
starters it's my personal condition. The other 
thing is that. Probably it's because I don't have 
like a strong community that I have that going on 
for me. That's what I don't get it. I don't know 
if people that are born here and have, like, a 
strong family and community ties. They have like 
a common garden, or they share their excess. Or 
surplus a harvest? Yeah, I think that it has to 
do also with the weather in Puerto Rico. You have 
like this weather that. So. It was a the concept 
of annuals and perennials. It's something that I 
learned just ten years ago. I was never aware 
because we don't have cold winters, that they are 
just plants that will just you cannot have every. 
I mean all year long in that same. By that same 
token, there are plans that you will never grow 
in Puerto Rico. You cannot grow apples, you 
cannot grow pears because the weather you will 
not have the freeze hours. So, the fact that 
people are sharing is because you have a constant 
supply of crops. So, you know that you know you 
can share because they're a couple of months 
again, you're going to have another harvest and 
that also it's very Puerto Rican you will share. 
And I mean I think that is part of the culture 
there that you have very close bonds with your 
neighbors and your family, and this is a very 
small island. It's very likely that you either 
are related with the people that you live nearby 
or that you know them from work or that so. Since 
it's a smaller island, communities are 
tighter. It doesn't mean that doesn't happen 
here. Is that, given my particular set of 
circumstances, I didn't know anybody, and I 
didn't do the job or the work to have those close 
community ties. 
Mendez: Have you ever experienced the communities in like 
the major pop ups in the United States like New 
York, Florida and Texas or Houston? More 
specifically of Puerto Rican population? And if 
so, do you think they've? I guess evolved or like 
mutated away from the traditional Puerto Rican 
experience. Or do you think it's more just 
they've more adapted to their circumstances in 
the United States? Food wise. Or just food wise, 
culturally. 
Aponte: Well, I think that at least from Puerto Ricans, 
when they will adapt, but they will maintain at 
least some basic essence. The basic essence of 
what they are. I can give you an example, I mean 
I've been here 10 years, and you will still go to 
my kitchen, and you will find rice beans and 
chicken Stew or a pork chop or carne frita or 
whatever. My food is not changing just because I 
came here. Definitely I have incorporated some 
things that I never have cooked before. Now I 
even own a smoker, and I smoke brisket and ribs, 
so it's a. I think that it's a process. You 
incorporate what you like the good things that 
you can find from your environment, and you keep 
the one that makes you I think that community 
wise it's the same they are and it's a very 
personal experience. There are people that are 
going to be more open. To their environment and 
they're going to be people that will not even 
experience something different, but it's 
personality. It's very I think that is very 
dangerous to try to generalize. And say that all 
Puerto Ricans are all people or all whatever are 
X or Y, because at the end it's a very personal 
experience. You will have some common traits 
because you have some common upbringings or 
common experiences or common culture, but at the 
end everything is an individual experience and 
what you do with it. It's a personal decision. 
Mendez: All right. And finally, let's bring it to a more 
lighter topic. I want to ask you, what is your 
favorite dish to prepare and why is it your 
favorite dish? And can you take us to the step by 
step on? How to make it? 
Aponte: OK, so if I have to, I have -- I have a couple. I 
think that I'm going to go with the one that my 
family, well, like the most, and I think that 
it's going to be white rice, pink or small red 
beans and fricassee or it's chicken Stew. So, for 
the white rice is not the same Asian white rice 
you boil water ratio 1/4 of a cup to a cup of 
medium grain rice. It's medium grain rice and you 
put it teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of oil. 
You bring your water to a boil when it's boiling, 
you put the rice. Let it boil for five to six 
minutes and then you cover and let it simmer 
there in low heat. 15 minutes in you turn it once 
and you let it cook there in small in slow heat. 
The bonus prize -- it's El Pegao, which is the 
part that that crunch. 
Mendez: Mm-hmm. 
Aponte: The part of the rice that it becomes sticky, or 
actually it sticks to the pot where I use the 
same aluminum cast iron pan that I've been using 
probably for the last 20 years, so that it makes 
a beautiful pegao, which is that crunchy rice 
that sticks to the bottom of the pan and that 
it's the crown the jewel of the crown. So that's 
the white rice. The beans you start by boiling 
probably 1/4 cup. No like half a cup of water, 
some potatoes and pumpkin. And when the potatoes 
and a little bit of cubes actually smoke ham, you 
put that you put it on in boil once it's boiled 
and you put the sofrito, it's something that we 
do in advance, or at least in my house, or we do 
in advance in huge batches. Put it in Mason jars 
and freeze it, and whenever 1 Mason jar is gone 
or that 16 ounce Mason jar is gone, you take the 
next one from the freezer but OK, so the sofrito 
it has it's it has Peppers and onions and garlic 
and coriander leaves and what else I put in it? 
And basically, that's it. So, you prepare a bunch 
of that, and you keep it in your fridge. So, I 
will take like a big tablespoon of that and put 
it in the water with the potatoes and the beans. 
Sorry, the potatoes, the pumpkin, and the ham, 
once everything is tender. Tablespoon of tomato 
paste, and I will put some powder chicken bullion 
into that. Put the beans in it and let it simmer. 
That will be beautiful beans. And then for the 
chicken Pollo Fricassee which is the chicken 
Stew, you will put some chicken thighs. It's my 
favorite. Take the skin off. Put the chicken in 
the in the pan again 2 full tablespoons of the 
sofrito and the chicken. You need to add the 
Waterloo which is put adobo on top of it before 
you put it on the pan to seal it. You cook it 
with a little bit of oil and once it's sealed in 
or I mean back and forth, you put it there, you 
throw your potatoes and. At least one beer and 
chicken bouillon and another set of cubes of the 
ham and your tomato paste. And you let it rest 
there until the potatoes are good and you have to 
put in order for it to be a fricassee. It needs 
to have Laurel, a Bay leaf. Sorry, Bay leaf. And 
that beer. And then you leave. Leave it there. 
Slow heat for at least 25-30 minutes, the chicken 
will fall off the bone. The stock is going to be 
thick and really flavorful, and I forgot that you 
have to also put like a very big portion of piano 
that will give that chicken like a very good 
flavor. You serve that and you have to have some 
tostones, which is the fried plantains you have 
to. They are double flying. You cut the 
plantains, fry them, smash them, fry them again. 
So that is that because we need to have something 
green. On that plate, we are going to have 
avocado. On the side with a little bit of olive 
oil and a sprinkle of salt and that will be the 
best Puerto Rican dish that you're going to 
have. 
Mendez: And why is that your favorite dish? 
Aponte: Ohh, because I like to eat it and because again 
everybody, if I, I mean it's it. It takes a 
little bit of time but it's really, really good. 
It's warm and it's salty and or savory. And I 
mean and you have texture, I mean textural. You 
have something crunchy. You have the chicken, and 
you have the rice and a little bit of pegao, 
which is also crunchy. And you have the seeds the 
pumpkin gives that little bit of sweet to it, and 
then you have the tostones riser, crunchy. You 
have the avocado that is creamy. So, what is? I 
mean you don't you have everything in a single 
plate. What is not to like? And at least in my 
household, if I I'm 100% that I do that. If I 
cook that, everybody will be a happy camper. 
Mendez: Alright. Well thank you for that interview. This is 
me, Francisco Mendez, signing off till next.
