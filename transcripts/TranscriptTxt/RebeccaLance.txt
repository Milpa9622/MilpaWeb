Place of Interview: Unknown




Willow Lance: Hello, my name is Willow Lance. It's April 
29th, 2024, and I'm here interviewing Rebecca 
Lance about her honeybee farm. So, if you just 
want to introduce yourself a little bit.
Rebbeca Lance: Okay. I'm, of course, Rebecca Lance. I'm 45. 
I'm a mom of three. I have a 17-year-old, 20-
year-old, and 24-year-old. I have my first 
grandbaby on the way. Oh, I picked out my name as 
Grandmother, it's going to be Honey. 
Willow Lance: Oh okay! [laughs]
Rebbeca Lance: So, I'm excited about that. And yeah, I've 
worked in the automotive industry for about 9 
years. So, I've been a finance manager, and I 
just -- I decided that I wanted a hobby, I guess, 
for the first time, really. 
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, I wanted to do honeybees because it was 
something I wanted to do a long time ago when all 
of my children were really young and little, and 
I researched it a little bit back then I just 
didn't have the ability to have the land or the 
setup that I wanted to do. So, I've been having 
it on the back of my mind. 
Willow Lance: Right, because I remember our phone -- our 
phone name was named Rebecca's Honeybees. 
Rebbeca Lance: Yes, I actually started to try to get all 
the business, everything put together back then -
-
Willow Lance: Right 
Rebbeca Lance: -- but I just wasn't able to pull it off, 
so. 
Willow Lance: Yeah, yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: So yeah, so I have them now. And I -- I 
named my brand this time Dancing Bees Elixir.
Willow Lance: Okay. Is there a reason why?
Rebbeca Lance: Uh yeah, actually. So, when I first started 
doing a little bit of research, more about them 
recently and I found out that the bees will fly 
up to a couple miles away --
Willow Lance: Hmm. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- to look for patches of flowers and -- and 
whatever to gather their -- their pollen and 
whatnot. And when they fly back to the colony, 
they actually do a dance to explain to the other 
bees where this patch of flowers was that they 
found. It's up to two miles away.
Willow Lance: Yeah! 
Rebbeca Lance: So, they danced around giving directions. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] That's so cool!
Rebbeca Lance: And that's how the other bees know by their 
dance actions and movements where to fly around 
to find those flowers at. 
Willow Lance: Okay! 
Rebbeca Lance: So, I thought that was so cool. 
Willow Lance: Yeah. Yeah, that's so interesting. So, is 
there like a specific reason why you've always 
wanted to do bees? And specifically, like 
honeybees.
Rebbeca Lance: Um well, I just I -- I just for some reason 
it just struck me as interesting --
Willow Lance: Yeah, yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- and I remember actually watching a -- a 
movie actually. I think it was Fried Green 
Tomatoes --
Willow Lance: Okay 
Rebbeca Lance: -- and she goes out and they're at the 
picnic and she walks out and she finds bees, 
honeybees, in a tree -- in a hollowed out tree. 
And she gets the honeycomb out of there and gets 
the honey and her friend calls her a bee charmer. 
And I remember being terrified and so intrigued 
all at the same time that she had bees all over 
her, she wasn't getting stung, she was getting 
the honey out, and just the idea, being a bee 
charmer. And I was just drawn to that. And I was 
like, I want to see if I can do that.
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: And I'm not afraid of bees, where people 
kind of run and get scared of them. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: I've been stung before, but just for some 
reason they don't bother me. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: So the idea of just golden sugar and having 
something sweet and neat and it just -- I don't 
know for some reason -- well and also too, you 
know, I have my flowers and I've always wanted a 
garden and the bees are really important to you 
know, cross pollinate or to do different things 
to help that grow. And at the time I was also 
looking at doing pumpkins and pumpkin patch stuff 
and everything. I was looking at land.
Willow Lance: Ohhh. 
Rebbeca Lance: And they're really good to have both your 
pumpkin patches and your bees together because it 
helps to pollinate everything to help have a 
stronger uh harvest, so --
Willow Lance: Okay, I didn't know that. 
Rebbeca Lance: It was something that I was kind of looking 
at just as kind of side, extra income that I 
thought I might actually be able to accomplish 
and still enjoy. 
Willow Lance: Right. Right. Right. So you mentioned how 
this was kind of a lifelong dream, but when 
exactly did you start being able to actually have 
the honey bees and -- and take care of them and 
everything?
Rebbeca Lance: Well, last year was my first time. 
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm.
Rebbeca Lance: And I've actually been talking about it for 
a while with, like, my parents.
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm. 
Rebbeca Lance: And, um -- but they decided they wanted to 
do it too, which I thought was really neat, 
because now it's going to be kind of this family 
thing --
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- that -- and then my sister got involved 
and she wanted to do it too. And I work a lot of 
hours.
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm. 
Rebbeca Lance: And so they had classes that you could take, 
but they were on Saturdays. And I always work 
Saturdays.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: I can't get out of the auto industry on 
Saturdays. So they actually took the class and 
they actually would come back and tell me stuff. 
And so --
Willow Lance: Okay. So, you didn't go to the class at all. 
Rebbeca Lance: I didn't go to the class, but it was really 
kind of neat that this was something I wanted and 
I initiated and then my parents got on board, my 
sister got on board and then they actually took 
the extra step to take the class so they could 
come back and tell me what was what.
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, it was really a special kind of family 
involved --
Willow Lance: Yeah, that's nice. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- bonding experience that we're all still 
king of learning as we go together and so I got 
my first uh hive of honeybees and my box last 
year. But I had to keep it on his property 
because we lived in town. 
Willow Lance: Yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: And um so that was, you know, I didn't get 
to still be a part of it. 
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm. 
Rebbeca Lance: And then we finally moved out to the 
country. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, it was really exciting but by the time I 
did the move and I was able to get my boxes, they 
had gotten infested.
Willow Lance: Oh, okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: My bees abandoned. They -- first, they 
abandoned and flew off. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Sometimes it will happen if they're under 
threat or if the queen wants to leave or another 
queen comes about and takes over, or if they get 
too large for the hive, sometimes they'll go find 
something else. And because I didn't live close 
by -- 
Willow Lance: Yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- and I wasn't there every day checking on 
them, or every week or whatever. I think that it 
kind of - just didn't happen. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And then my box got overtaken with moths and 
mites and different types of bugs.
Willow Lance: Oh, okay. And normally if you catch it in 
time, you can treat it or you can be preemptive 
and treat for certain things in certain seasons 
if you know they're going to happen. I know that 
now. Yeah. [laughs]
Rebbeca Lance: [laughs] So, it's definitely been a learning 
experience. And um, I tried cleaning it because 
sometimes if you catch it early and if you can 
clean them and treat them, there's certain ways 
to treat them. But mine was so overtaken and I 
cleaned it and cleaned it and cleaned it and I 
couldn't get it right. I got so frustrated I 
actually burned it in a bonfire. And I -- I 
painted that. I spent so many hours. I got a wood 
burner, and I decorated the whole -- all -- the 
whole hive with all of the -- this wood burn art 
design --
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- I was really proud of it. So that was 
really sickening and disappointing. 
Willow Lance: Yeah. [laughs]
Rebbeca Lance: But -- so, I just got all brand new setups 
and this year I got 2.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Um so, I'm going to try it again. 
Willow Lance: Okay, yes. 
Rebbeca Lance: Now last year I did get my first harvest 
though, so I do actually have honey. 
Willow Lance: Okay, okay! 
Rebbeca Lance: I do have honey and what's really odd about 
it is that my hives were -- were a few feet away 
from my father and my -- my parents, and then a 
few feet further were my sister's hives. And when 
we harvested our honey, mine tasted different 
than theirs. 
Willow Lance: Okay, interesting!
Rebbeca Lance: Mine had and -- and I didn't even know that 
they could do that. 
Willow Lance: Yeah, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: And my sisters, especially hers, had more of 
a citrusy flavor? 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And mine had more of a warm kind of earthy 
flavor, like it was sweet, but it was -- I can't 
exactly explain the flavor -- 
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- but it was distinctively different.
Willow Lance: Okay, do you -- do you know like why?
Rebbeca Lance: No, we really can't know why -- 
Willow Lance: Ahh. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- because we're like, obviously we would 
assume that they were all probably travelling 
into the same area. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: They were in the same market for the same 
flowers, so I can't imagine why it would be 
different.
Willow Lance: Interesting.
Rebbeca Lance: But it was -- it was really neat. 
Willow Lance: Yeah!
Rebbeca Lance: and I'm sure there's a reason why that 
somebody that is experienced would be able to 
answer --
Willow Lance: Yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- but I didn't know that. But it was really 
-- it was really interesting. But theirs, their 
hives produced more honey than mine did, which 
also kind of caught me off guard, too, is because 
when you first get your bees, we would take our 
boxes up there. And they would put the bees in 
them for a period of time to get them acclimated 
and they would start to build like their 
honeycomb and the hive up. And mine was thriving. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: Mine was just almost overrun, it was 
thriving. It just took off. And definitely in 
comparison to my parents or my sister, so I just 
knew my honey was just going to be abundant --
Willow Lance: [laughs]
Rebbeca Lance: -- and it was really odd too, that when we 
did our harvest, I probably had the least amount 
of honey than they did.
Willow Lance: Interesting. 
Rebbeca Lance: So that wasn't something that I can say "Oh, 
you know, that automatically means you're going 
to have more," or maybe they just were like, 
we're not producing much for this lady because 
we're fixing to book it out of town anyway.
Willow Lance: [laughs] Oh no. 
Rebbeca Lance: [laughs] So I don't really know, but -- 
Yeah, yeah. So that happened. 
Willow Lance: Okay, so the -- what are kind of like the 
steps to starting the -- the honeybee stuff 
because you said how it sounds like you get the 
box first and then you go get the bees or kind 
of...?
Rebbeca Lance: Yes. So well, the way we did it, you can buy 
the box separately and then you can buy the bees 
separately and then put them in your box, right?
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Um, or you can order it to come with the 
bees inside the box.
Willow Lance: Oh, okay, okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And I ordered mine to come inside. 
Willow Lance: Mm. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, the first go around, we actually built 
our own boxes. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: So we got the kit and it was uh -- it was 
interesting to do. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: And of course, at the same time, my aunt and 
my cousin also had honeybees and boxes that they 
got to do on their property. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, they came over my sister, myself, my 
parents, my aunt, my cousin -- we were all in the 
shop just tinkering away building boxes. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Mm-hmm. 
Rebbeca Lance: And it was a very tedious and grueling, and 
I found out [laughs] after the fact that you 
could get them pre-built for you for like 30 
bucks.
Willow Lance: Ohh [laughs]
Rebbeca Lance: [laughs] and it took us like a whole day. 
But at the first time around, when I did that, we 
got our boxes first and I was able to paint them 
and decorate them. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: Um, because there's -- there's three layers, 
and so the bottom one in the brood box. When we 
built it, I was able to paint it first, go turn 
it back in, then they put the bees in.
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: This time when I got the box, it already had 
the bees in it. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So it's a little different, this go around 
than it was last go around. I got 'em from the 
same place, but they did it differently. But it 
was definitely worth the extra 30 bucks --
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- to have them build it. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: I will say that right now, I'll probably 
never build another one again.
Willow Lance: [laughs] Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So you get the first box, the brood box, and 
it's the one that will be on the bottom. So if 
you're ever driving down the road and you see bee 
boxes stacked up, the one on the bottom is where 
the Queens at. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So you start out with that one first, and 
that's the one your bees come in, and then you're 
going to have more boxes you stack on top, I have 
two more that stack on top, and they come in 
different sizes. You can get them where they're a 
little bit shorter --
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- or you can get them a little bit taller, 
more full size. It really just kind of depends, 
it's a personal choice, I think. Um based on the 
very little conversation I've had about it. 
Willow Lance: Right. [laughs] 
Rebbeca Lance: Because I thought I was getting the -- the 
shorter ones because that's what I got last year. 
This year they gave me the taller ones -- 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- and the way it was explained is they'll 
just um make more, and we'll have more space to 
fill. The reason to get the shorter boxes that 
you stack on top of the brood box, which has all 
the starter bees and everything in it, is because 
it gets real heavy with honey.
Willow Lance: Ohh. 
Rebbeca Lance: And so they're harder to lift.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: But I also -- I guess that would mean 
there's more space to fill more honey in.
Willow Lance: Right, right.
Rebbeca Lance: So, I guess it's just a personal choice. So, 
um, this year we got them and we set them out. 
They need to be in full sun because I really had 
a pretty little spot under the tree with the 
branches hanging over and the flowers- I wanted 
to tuck them in this little nook and I was told I 
couldn't do that. [laughs] So, that -- that 
definitely took that idea. So, we put them out on 
the far South Acre -- actually, North Acre of the 
property and in a completely open area. Nowhere 
near trees or shade or anything, and really the 
furthest point from the house.
Willow Lance: Yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, like for example, yesterday my mom was 
out. She was just working in her garden, but they 
have their bee boxes on the other side of their 
garden and it was early morning and they're not 
as active in the morning. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So, she thought that was a safe time, but 
she has allergic reactions to them --
Willow Lance: Ohh. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- and one had stung her on her face next to 
her eye, and the whole right side of her face is 
swollen and her eyes swollen shut and she's in a 
lot of pain, so.
Willow Lance: Oh my goodness. 
Rebbeca Lance: With the grandbaby coming and all the kids 
running around out here, we wanted them kind of 
in the furthest corner that doesn't have any of 
the greenhouses or chicken coop or garden or pool 
or anything. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: We don't want anybody really actively 
messing around out there unless we're 
intentionally out there for a reason. So. But 
they need to be in full sun because they need to 
stay warm. I got two different kinds this year. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: I got one box that has Texas -- they're 
called Texas 5000. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And the information on those is specifically 
that they will produce more honey. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: They're hardier.
Willow Lance: That's nice. 
Rebbeca Lance: But they tend to be more aggressive.
Willow Lance: Hmm.
Rebbeca Lance: And then I got the other ones which are the 
Golden Cordova. I think they're Tian Golden 
Cordova, specifically, and they produce a little 
bit less honey, they're not as hardy, but they're 
more docile. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: Um, I know, I don't remember if it was my 
dad or someone else, who said that he couldn't 
tell the difference from one to the other. 
Willow Lance: Oh.
Rebbeca Lance: So, I don't really know, but I decided I 
want to try one of each. I wanted to see if they 
did behave differently, if they withstood the 
challenges the same or differently, if they -- 
the honey tasted different, I don't know. 
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, I decided to try one of each since I'm 
new to see which one direction I might lean 
towards moving forward in the future, but 
eventually what happens is -- you have a queen 
that's in that box and in the beginning, right 
now, we've attached an extended little 
contraption that kind of goes on the front of it 
that's got sugar-water in it. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So, it really -- it kind of helps supplement 
them in the beginning 'cause they've got to get 
acclimated to their new territory, find out where 
their flowers that they're going to want to go 
to, they need water sources constantly. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: Um, and then -- so, you kind of help them 
boost because the boxes themselves um -- oh my 
gosh, what's it called? There's a term for it, 
but -- and it's gonna come to me in a second 
because I need to say it -- it -- it's slipped my 
mind, but think of it like, um, there's -- you 
got the box, you got the four walls, and you got 
the bottom and the top.
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm.
Rebbeca Lance: Inside of the box, there is about 10 panels, 
kind of, um -- oh my goodness it's going to 
bother me -- but the top of these wooden bars and 
you can slide it -- you can pull them upwards -- 
out and inside it'll be this mesh. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Okay, and it's like a screen and it's got 
the mesh -- it should -- So it's like a wax. 
Willow Lance: Ohh. 
Rebbeca Lance: And it's already kind of pre shaped, very 
lightly -- it's very thin, very light, pre shaped 
kind of in a honeycomb type shape.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And so, you got ten of these in there. So, 
when you want to check them, you can lift each 
one individually out, and you can check the 
screen to see how much are they really growing on 
the honeycomb? How much are they adding the honey 
to it? How productive are they being? So, you can 
pull them up individually. And I noticed last 
year when we did that, certain ones of them, 
maybe towards the center, would be heavier and 
more fulfilled -- more filled than the ones on 
the outside, or vice versa. So, um -- so the 
beginning stages really you want to help give 
them an extra boost with the -- the sugar water. 
And it's crazy how much they go through really 
quick since we brought them home. Basically, 
you'll do half and half. So like if you have a 
gallon of water, you're going to get rid of half 
of that water and then fill it up with um -- the 
rest of the way with sugar. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And you want to heat the water up a little 
bit, so it helps dissolve the sugar easier. And 
we filled out, it's like a mason jar, it's turned 
upside down, it's got holes punched into it. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, you put your really thick sugar water in 
there and they just lick on it and it drips down 
into the little tray. And so, what they do right 
now is -- is they take that screen, with all 
those little wax honeycombs, and they're just 
building bigger honeycomb. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So right now, they're not collecting honey 
and they're not creating honey. Right now, 
they're just -- they're -- they're working hard 
to build, basically the foundation. And, of 
course, the queen's in there and they got to take 
care of the queen. Eventually, the -- once they 
get that established is when they'll start to -- 
then start producing and making the honey. And 
then as it grows, that's where you start adding 
those -- the second and the third box on top, 
because now they need to expand.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And they need to grow up into it. And those 
top two boxes are where you're going to get your 
honey --
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: -- because the queen is going to stay on the 
bottom and she's going to lay her eggs. And so 
you basically are going to have four different 
types of bees. You're going to have -- and 
predominantly the bees that run the joint are all 
female.
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, uh, the queen will lay the eggs -- so 
you got your drones, which are male. Their only 
purpose in existing is to reproduce. And they 
even get like the garbage honey and the garbage 
feed. They don't even let them eat the good 
stuff. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Oh no. 
Rebbeca Lance: [laughs] Yeah. Yeah. They don't treat them 
very good. And then they die. So that's pretty 
much their purpose. That's it. And then you have 
your worker bees that basically -- their job is 
to just constantly build the honeycomb. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And process the honey and everything. Then 
you have, um -- you have your other set of bees 
that their sole purpose is to tend to all of the 
eggs and the queen. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And then you have your bees that go out in 
search of the flowers for the pollen and 
everything with that --
Willow Lance: Right, right.
Rebbeca Lance: -- and bring it back. Um, so -- um, yeah. So 
that's basically kind of just the hierarchy of 
it. Now, it's the worker bees, though, that 
decide when the queen is no longer in reign. 
Willow Lance: Ohh.
Rebbeca Lance: So, if she stops producing or doing her job 
to their liking, they're going to start tending 
to one of those eggs, more specifically. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And they're going to pick which egg -- 
they're going to pick which one is gonna -- gonna 
become their new queen.
Willow Lance: I did not know that. That's cool.
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah. So, they're going to nurture this and 
then -- this queen -- and they're going to decide 
that it's time for the old queen to move on.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And they'll kill her. And then they'll put 
the new queen into action.
Willow Lance: Interesting.
Rebbeca Lance: And then bees only have about a two-week 
lifespan. 
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: And so, the reason is -- is because when 
they fly around their wings get so tattered from 
the wind and the rain and the elements that they 
just eventually their wings start to tatter and 
tear up -- that they just fall on the ground and 
lay there till they die.
Willow Lance: Ohh. 
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah, it's pretty sad. Or when you have to 
lift a box up to check on the honey, and they 
always want to crawl around, and we set a box 
down, they always get squished.
Willow Lance: [laughs] Ohh no. Does -- does the queen also 
only have a two-week lifespan? Or is that just 
the ones that go out? 
Rebbeca Lance: No, she'll live longer.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: I don't actually know how long she lives, so 
that's a good question. I need to figure that 
out. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: I don't know how long that lasts, but if the 
queen decides to move on, the colony will follow 
her. 
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, if the queen gets out and flies away, 
they will all leave wherever they're at and 
follow her wherever she goes. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So, there's that. 
Willow Lance: Yeah. Is there like -- any, like, specific 
reasons that she would ever want to leave? Like I 
know you mentioned earlier how you had an 
infestation so that's like, obviously, one -- 
Rebbeca Lance: Well, and sometimes infestation doesn't 
happen till the box is empty too -- 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- especially with the moths and things. If 
you have a strong hive and you then get mites, or 
something like that, sometimes they can take care 
of 'em. 
Willow Lance: Right, okay that makes sense. 
Rebbeca Lance: And take care of themselves. Um so yeah, so 
that's kind of the basic starting, beginning 
point.
Willow Lance: Right, right.
Rebbeca Lance: So um, what's your next question?
Willow Lance: Um, earlier you mentioned these classes that 
your sister and your parents would go to. Is that 
required to get bees like to -- do you have to 
have, like, a license of some sort or can really 
like anybody just go and get bees?
Rebbeca Lance: Anybody can go do it.
Willow Lance: Really? So, the class isn't needed. It was 
just something that you guys decided to do for 
extra --
Rebbeca Lance: We decided to do it and then, you know, I'll 
be really honest -- and it could be very specific 
to the place that they went.
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm.
Rebbeca Lance: And my dad is very studious. My, my parents, 
they're very research, you know --
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- people, inventors, creators, they -- they 
perfect everything that they do all the time is 
kind of their thing. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: They were actually falling asleep in the 
class. [laughs]
Willow Lance: [laughs] Oh no.
Rebbeca Lance: They struggled; they said it was painful. 
Willow Lance: Really? 
Rebbeca Lance: Because the person I think that was teaching 
it was very slow and not energetic and I think 
just kind of droned on a lot about certain things 
that I think that probably classes somewhere else 
would have been maybe more beneficial. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: I think it was probably the place that they 
chose to go. 
Willow Lance: Maybe. 
Rebbeca Lance: Um, but -- but I think that most of the 
research we've gotten there or obtained, we got 
online or from books. 
Willow Lance: Okay, okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And watching videos -- and the other thing 
too that you have to keep in mind is there's a 
million different opinions on how to do the same 
thing.
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: And it's almost overwhelming because 
everybody's got opposing opinions on it, but it's 
working successfully for each of them 
individually. 
Willow Lance: Right!
Rebbeca Lance: So, I don't think there's an exact science 
to it. 
Willow Lance: Right. There's no one way.
Rebbeca Lance: I think it's about finding what works for 
your bees, what works -- and it's also in your 
climate, so like, what? Bee -- I'm going to call 
them bee charmers. What beach charmers would do 
in Texas are going to be completely different 
than Michigan. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: Or New Yo[rk] -- it's going to be dependent 
on the climate when your harvest is going to be 
different based on the weather and the 
temperature and the times, you know, everything. 
All of these things play a factor, so you have to 
also make sure that when you're doing your 
research, you're following local people. 
Willow Lance: Right, right.
Rebbeca Lance: And people that are established in it and 
reading books that pertain to your location. 
Willow Lance: Yes, yes.
Rebbeca Lance: So that's extremely important. And that's 
something that we kind of discovered over time. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance:So yeah. But I would advise anybody to get 
that started because even though they said that, 
they probably still gathered some necessary 
information, that really helped kind of jump-
start it for them, so.
Willow Lance: Yeah, yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: But I didn't go to the class, so that's the 
only opinion I can give. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: Is the one I heard through gossip. [laughs] 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Yeah. Um, do you remember the -- the 
name of the place you got your bees and your -- 
your setup from?
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah, it's called the Bee Supply.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And what's really amazing about it is 
there's an actual -- it's, it's located literally 
right down the road from where I live.
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: It's an actual store- so you can order 
everything online. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And there's a lot of places I'm sure you can 
order stuff from, but they actually have it and 
you can go in and they have a little store. You 
can buy all of the accessories, all of the things 
you need, you can order your bees. We went and 
picked up our bees on Friday, actually. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: And put them in the back of the truck and 
drove home with them.
Willow Lance: So -- so these bees that you have now are 
like really recent? 
Rebbeca Lance: They're very recent. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: I've only had him for a few days. 
Willow Lance: Okay, okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: So yes, the -- the new set that I have is 
very recent, but it's neat. So, got all of the 
proper gear and everything, because when I was 
going to my dad's I was using his equipment -- 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- and now I'm getting my own setup so 
that's really kind of neat too.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So yeah, but we got ours from the Bee Supply 
and they're very knowledgeable and they're 
excited to share their information -- 
Willow Lance: [laughs] That's good. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- like they're -- it's like when you go to 
places and people are really into what they do. 
Willow Lance: Yeah, that's- that's always a good sign.
Rebbeca Lance: So that -- that's nice because they'll talk 
to you for hours if you need it.
Willow Lance: Right, right. So, you just mentioned the -- 
the equipment, so what kind of equipment is 
needed?
Rebbeca Lance: Um so, right now, to begin with, of course 
we got the -- the jars for the sugar water, so 
that was extra things that we got to add on to 
the box and then we got -- and this is just what 
I've seen everybody do, this is what we did is, 
you know, obviously went to Home Depot, got 
cinder blocks to raise them off the ground. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Make them higher. And then there was like a 
tool because everything starts to get real sticky 
in there.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So, when you want to pull out your sleeves, 
and I'm going to call them sleeves because for 
whatever reason the correct term is left in my 
brain -- 
Willow Lance: [laughs] That's all right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- but there's this metal tool that's got a 
hook on one end -- there's two -- there's two 
hooks, so one of them's kind of flat and chiseled 
a little bit, it's metal, and then the other end 
hooks, and it's probably 10 inches long, I want 
to say. And so, you use the flat end to separate 
your tray sleeve things that they do the 
honeycomb and the honey in. And then you turn 
around and flip it and you put your hook under 
the bottom of the top bar, which is wood, to kind 
of pop it up.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So that you can then grab it and pull it out 
and you can inspect what they accomplished. If 
they're ready to harvest it, they need to have 
more time. If you need to inspect for mites, or 
if you need to inspect for certain things.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And so, got one of those. They have a brush 
that they'll give you to like, brush off your 
bees. Like what I was talking about, you set your 
boxes down, it squashes them the second you dust 
them off, there's more crawl out and you just 
it's inevitable. So that ended up being a little 
useless.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: In our opinion anyways, and then we have a 
smoker. We have a smoker that we put like 
shavings in uh, sometimes like hay shavings or 
you can get like little cedar wood chips or 
whatever. So you can go to the feed store or the 
tractor supply and get a bag real cheap. And it's 
-- it kind of looks like a tin can kind of like 
an oiling can kind of thing. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: It's cylinder and it kind of comes out to 
this point a little bit at the top. And you can 
pump it -- so you set everything on fire, but you 
just get it smoldering and then you go out there 
and when you want to mess with your bees, you're 
going to pump it and it's going to shoot smoke 
out of the top of the cylinder and you're going 
to smoke your bees and it calms them down.
Willow Lance: Okay, so it doesn't -- it doesn't hurt them 
at all? None of them have like died from it?
Rebbeca Lance: No, no, no, no, no, it's not harmful to them 
on any level at all. But it's calming to them or 
shoos them away. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: They kind of will keep their distance, but 
they don't get really aggressive. So one of the 
things that's really good that we would do is we 
would team up so to the one person -- because if 
one person's handling moving the boxes and 
lifting the lids and pulling out the different 
trays. They can get aggressive, so it's good to 
have somebody standing next to you that's 
constantly pumping the smoke out -- 
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- and you just kind of -- like I would 
notice if Dad was doing it, they would start kind 
of swarming around him, I could start pumping it 
on his legs or his arms, and then it would clear 
them out from his body. 
Willow Lance: Okay!
Rebbeca Lance: Or if they were sworn around the top of the 
box, when you lift the lid off to start messing 
with the inside -- inner workings of it, you 
could pump it across the top and it would calm 
them down and kind of clear them out from the top 
so you could work without them being in the way. 
So, and of course, they never just leave. There's 
constantly still be swarming around you. 
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: Constantly, but they tend to not be as 
aggressive and it's not always going to calm the 
situation. Sometimes you get them on the wrong 
day or the wrong attitude, or I don't know, 
there's an inner civil war and you decide to show 
up in there or something. [laughs] They're going 
to, they're going to sting you and attack.
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: And you'll hear different people that talk 
about it. They're like, "Oh, I go out all the 
time. I don't even put on any of my protective 
gear. My bees don't have problems." And then 
they're like, "I don't know what happened today. 
We didn't do anything different. Everything was 
normal and they just attacked me." So, you have 
to be really careful -- is that even the most 
experienced people -- 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- can go out to their bees. that they mess 
with on a regular basis, that they act pretty 
calm around them and then all of a sudden they're 
agitated and they're going to start to attack.
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, we tend to, it's better to wear clothes 
like jeans like overall something that's not 
tight on your skin.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Because they can still puncture through your 
clothes and get you. 
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Especially if they start attacking you a lot 
and then even if you're not allergic to them, too 
many stings can become harmful. 
Willow Lance: Well, yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: If you know it goes really, really South 
really quick. So you, you know, we wear mud boots 
and we wear loose clothings. I always had my 
overalls or something like that. And then we have 
these gloves. Um, that go up like you pull them 
up and they go past your elbows and they got 
elastic, so they're tight. And then we were like 
bee hats. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: With the screen kind of mesh that comes 
around down to the shoulders. Some people like to 
wear the full suits.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And the full suits are really good, like if 
it's cold outside.
Willow Lance: Yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: But here, in Texas, you walk out with one of 
those suits and you're gonna be laying out on the 
ground next -- because it's hot. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Yeah, yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah, it overheats you in a heartbeat.
Willow Lance: Okay. Yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: So we don't wear the suits. Uh, just because 
we found it to be extremely uncomfortable. And 
kind of more difficult to do what you need to do 
just because you're just dripping sweat and dying 
and everything in there, so kind of distracts you 
from what you need to get done and get it in to 
get out. But that's kind of what we do with that. 
Then there's other things like when you want to 
get the honey. So when we harvested last year, 
it's this big barrel, what we got, and I'm sure 
that they have different contraptions that you 
can use. We have this one particular one. And 
it's got -- it's hollow on the inside to a sense 
and uh think of it like a big metal cylinder 
that's on a stand and it probably comes up, so 
I'm 6 foot tall, so it probably comes up maybe to 
my belly button a little bit higher at the top of 
it. And it's probably, I want to say maybe a foot 
and a half to two feet across. Okay, so it's 
circular, so there's these hooks on the inner 
wall that when you take your sleeve -- your trays 
out that have the honeycomb, we first would put 
it over like a 5-gallon bucket and you put a 
strainer, and you want to have a strainer, but 
you'll -- you get it -- there's a certain knife 
that's so that you get, it's one of the tools, 
I'm sure different people use different things, 
very sharp and very flat and you're going to cut 
down both sides of the screen where they build 
the honeycomb and you're going to cut off that 
top layer. Because it's kind of sealed the honey 
in and when you do, you'll just start seeing that 
honey pour out.
Willow Lance: Okay, okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So then after you kind of open that up -- 
and then they have this other tool that's kind of 
like a comb, it's prickly, it's pronged and you 
kind of scrape down as well to kind of break it 
up.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And then we're going to slide it inside the 
cylinder that's got the hooks on the inner wall. 
And you're going to place all your sleeves in 
there. I think you can fit 4 to 5.
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm.
Rebbeca Lance: And then you close the lid on the top. And 
it's got a handle that spins in a big circle 
around the top.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Of the lid that you close and what it does 
is it starts to catch momentum and the cylinder 
starts to spin really fast.
Willow Lance: Oh.
Rebbeca Lance: And it starts to sling the honey out inside 
the cylinder. And so honey is just flying all 
inside. And it's kind of just the force of the 
spin. It's sucking it out to the walls.
Willow Lance: Right. Okay, okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: And then it runs all the way down to like a 
point in the center underneath the bottom of the 
cylinder.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: And then there's a spout. So it kind of goes 
flat, I guess, the spouts at the bottom and then 
you're also going to open your spout up and 
you're going to do it over a strainer into a 
bucket, or your containers you wanna use. And 
then there goes your honey. 
Willow Lance: Wow!
Rebbeca Lance: And that's how you get your honey out.
Willow Lance: Okay, I never knew that. I never knew there 
was like another contraption that you used. I 
don't know. I -- I don't know what I assumed 
people got the -- how they got the honey out.
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah. Yeah, I don't guess you don't think 
about it cause you just see people that are like 
honeycomb and jars and then like -- then the 
honey will fall out of the honeycomb.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And you can. So, we were trying it so we'd 
eat some of the honeycomb. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And it's like eating wax. You don't really 
chew it and swallow it. I mean, I'm sure some 
people do. Because you sell honeycomb, people 
eat. 
Willow Lance: Yeah. Yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: And I think they get it a lot of times for 
medicinal purposes?
Willow Lance: Hmm. 
Rebbeca Lance: I've heard of people that get that will 
order honeycomb and, like, rub it on their scalp 
to help their hair grow. You know, they can make, 
obviously, people make candles, lotions, 
different types of things. So, all the properties 
are really beneficial. We don't like to tear our 
honeycomb out, because that means the bees have 
to start all over. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: Not even just reproducing more honey to 
harvest, but to rebuild the honeycomb. 
Willow Lance: Yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: So you back track your bees a little bit if 
you take out the honeycomb. So we don't want to 
do that. We just want to break it open and sling 
that honey out and then put them back inside the 
boxes and let them continue working on what's 
kind of remaining leftover.
Willow Lance: Right, right.
Rebbeca Lance: Of course, and then you just jar it. You 
know ours is raw. We don't treat it. We don't put 
anything in it. And you have to be really 
careful, there's a lot of different places that 
treat it or mix it with water or do stuff to it 
and that's not pure honey. 
Willow Lance: Oh okay, but the raw honey is safe to 
consume. Like, there's no need to put any? 
Rebbeca Lance: No.
Willow Lance: Oh okay.
Rebbeca Lance: There's no expiration date on honey.
Willow Lance: Right. Okay. Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: It never expires. So like when people get 
their honey and they see that it crystallizes, it 
gets kind of crunchy and gross looking in the 
bottom of the bottle. There's nothing wrong with 
that honey, if you go boil water on your stove or 
do a double boiler and you just set your little 
bottle of honey in the water and it'll heat up 
and melt the honey and it turns right back into 
your golden clear honey.
Willow Lance: Oh, wow. Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah. So it never goes bad.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So you can do that and then of course, I 
haven't done this yet, but people will get the 
pollen and they actually will use the pollen in 
like teas or warm water or whatever. Um, for two 
reasons, because it helps well, it helps with 
allergies. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: People that have allergies, it helps them if 
they want a more holistic path to allergy 
medicine, basically, instead of taking actual 
chemicals or things over the counter. And that 
was the other thing is that we've all been trying 
to, you know raise cattle and eggs and the 
garden, and we're trying to go into more --
Willow Lance: Self-sufficient.
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah. We want to have a more holistic, 
natural -- we don't, we don't give anything to 
the animals that's not natural or antibiotics or 
preservatives or anything. We don't put anything 
in their food or give them the extra unnecessary 
antibiotics or anything like that. So, we're 
trying to go that route. So that was the other 
thing with the honey for natural sweetener and 
for allergies and stuff like that. So, the honey 
is really good to buy local honey. Because if you 
have allergies that are local to the plant life 
that you're around, if you consume the honey from 
that area, eventually you can help fight that 
off.
Willow Lance: Okay, that's interesting. So like when we get 
imported honey from other states or something, 
it's not gonna to work for you as well.
Rebbeca Lance: It won't have the same effect for you. It 
will still taste good, it's still good for you. 
There's nothing wrong with it, but it's not going 
to have any type of medicinal benefit to it.
Willow Lance: Okay. See, I never knew how you could have a 
medicinal benefit.
Rebbeca Lance: Mhm. So it's really good. So if you have 
allergies, which I have allergies, you know, we 
have different family members here that sneeze 
and have allergies all the time. So when they 
start eating the honey that we get off of our own 
farm.
Willow Lance: Mm-hmm.
Rebbeca Lance: With our own surroundings then we're really 
interested to see --
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- how accurate and true this really is. 
Willow Lance: Yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: Because we read about it, but experiencing 
it firsthand and being able to stand by it is 
something completely different, so I'm excited to 
see how well that works out.
Willow Lance: Yeah, yeah, that's so cool. Um, I guess 
another question I have is just kind of like how 
much time and money does it take to start this up 
and to keep it up and to do this type of thing.
Rebbeca Lance: So it -- investment in anything is always 
investment. So, I can say that I didn't spend 
that much time last year on mine, but I wasn't 
there, so this year you know, some people go 
check on their hives weekly, some daily, some 
check on them once a month.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: You know, so it's really going to be 
dependent again on the person. Everybody has 
different opinions on what works best. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So it's just about finding, you know, maybe 
you just want to go look at them, you want to go 
see their progress.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: Maybe you want to check more regularly for 
mites and things. I know that this is the hard 
part for me is people that are really 
experienced, they can find the queen. They know 
what the queen looks like. They know how to find 
it. They can tell if there's another up-and-
coming Queen. If they want to pick and choose 
they can pinch one off. They're like Okay, 
because sometimes it'll divide a -- because 
sometimes it will divide -- Uh -- a colony also. 
Willow Lance: Ohh.
Rebbeca Lance: And so if they don't want to run the risk of 
their colony flying away, they have to make a 
judgment call. And I was talking to a lady at the 
bees supply store that she did that and I was 
like, I wouldn't even begin to know which one is 
the queen.
Willow Lance: So, haven't seen your -- 
Rebbeca Lance: I mean, there's thousands of them in there. 
I don't know which ones which.
Willow Lance: Right. Because I always thought that the 
queen bee always had, like, a distinctive, like 
she was bigger or something. Is that like a?
Rebbeca Lance: Well, yes, but when they're all buzzing 
around in there and I'm still kind of getting 
used to just how the functionality and the inner 
workings of it, I'm not, I'm not able to just 
look in there be like, oh, boom, there she is or 
oh, look, there's a baby queen coming up that 
looks like she's fixing to cause mutiny. I don't 
know how to tell --
Willow Lance: [laughs] Yeah
Rebbeca Lance: So, uh, but I want to say the two setups -- 
That I got 2 brand new setups, 2 brand new 
colonies of bees, I got the smoker, I got the two 
hats with the nets, the two sets of the gloves, I 
got the tool to separate everything and lift out, 
and I got -- what else did I get?
Willow Lance: Do you have your own like honey separators 
thing?
Rebbeca Lance: I don't have the honey separator, so that 
will be something I'll buy when it's time to 
harvest or I'll just use, you know, Grampy's. But 
I want to say that this probably cost me, in all, 
probably about $1400. 
Willow Lance: Really?
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah.
Willow Lance: Wow.
Rebbeca Lance: And last year I bought a bunch of bottles 
with lids. 
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: So that was another. You know, I mean, I 
bought a bunch, but probably about 300 bucks. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So, it's an initial investment. Now if they 
stick around and they last they -- now I have 
everything. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So the idea is, is that I won't have to 
reinvest in any of this stuff again. Now the 
honey we- we harvested, I hoarded mine. I gave 
some away to like friends and family because I 
didn't know when I was going to have another 
harvest and I didn't. I wasn't quite ready to 
like deplete my supply. But my sister, she sold 
her honey. 
Willow Lance: Okay, 
Rebbeca Lance: And I want to say, I think the 8 oz she did 
for like 8 bucks, 16 ounces, 16 bucks,
Willow Lance: Okay
Rebbeca Lance: And she put all of hers out on her 
neighborhood Facebook page there was just 
literally the -- the few blocks in her 
neighborhood. She sold out of her honey within a 
few hours.
Willow Lance: Wow!
Rebbeca Lance: And she had people like reaching out wanting 
honey that she'd had to turn away. 
Willow Lance: Oh my goodness. 
Rebbeca Lance: So, it's something that if you start growing 
and you get more hives because the goal is, is 
that we eventually want to, you know, get more 
hives, larger quantities of honey, expand that -- 
expand the garden, and expand the other things 
we're doing and start going to farmers markets on 
the weekends and selling it and having fun with 
it and just having it more of a family -- because 
right now, you know, Maddie, your sister, she's 
working on the farm with me. So she's helping me 
get -- have all this come to fruition while I 
work full time.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: So that's the goal. The other thing that a 
lot of bee farmers do is they rent their bees out 
to place -- so you'll have big plantations, like 
in California, or big huge farms and other states 
that they will rent bees. And so you ship them to 
them and they put them on their farms and the 
bees will fly around and pollinate and cross 
pollinate all of their fruits and vegetables.
Willow Lance: Okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: And then you pack up your bees and you ship 
them back home. And now you get them back with 
honey.
Willow Lance: Oh, that's cool.
Rebbeca Lance: And then you can harvest the honey and 
talking to the Bee Supply people, they said that 
they probably made just as much, if not more, 
money renting out their bees to farmers than they 
do making off the honey. So you can do both.
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So now you can rent your bees out, get them 
back, and then you can harvest the honey and sell 
the honey.
Willow Lance: Right. Well, then renting the bees. I feel 
like is kind of like -- I bet it makes you feel 
good because like, you know that you're helping 
somebody like make their farm strong and- and 
like helping you know the environment and food 
production and everything like that. So you're 
playing a part in that by renting your bees out.
Rebbeca Lance: Well, what it shows you is -- is how of a 
prominent fixture of the importance of having 
bees are to the farm industry, to the food 
industry, to the production for -- to keep supply 
going for the populations and there was a really 
scary time where they were continuing to talk 
about the decline in the bee population and how 
that would actually affect everybody in a very 
negative way. 
Willow Lance: Yeah, yeah. 
Rebbeca Lance: And so for everybody, whether your heart -- 
a hobby, a person like myself, or you decide to 
grow into a company that's larger than life, you 
know it's all extremely essential to continuing 
the processing and ability to have food made 
available to people.
Willow Lance: Yeah, yeah, for sure. These have always, 
like, I mean, growing up, you're always taught 
how important bees are and everything. So it's 
just, it's like interesting that even as just a 
hobby, just so you can get some honey like, you 
know that like your bees are going to go out and 
pollinate flowers and plants and trees, and all 
of that, just to come back home and produce you 
some, some honey. I mean, that's super 
interesting.
Rebbeca Lance: Uh-huh. Well, what it is they when they fly 
back and they have the pollen, they get it on 
their back legs. And if you look at them, 
sometimes it's yellow, sometimes it's pink, 
sometimes it's red or orange. It depends on what 
flowers they go to.
Willow Lance: Oh okay.
Rebbeca Lance: So it's not always the same colors and then 
they have the bees inside that will process it 
and then they basically, I don't know, like they 
eat it and regurgitate it. I don't know what it 
is, but it's an enzyme inside their body that 
actually turns it into honey.
Willow Lance: Okay, yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: And the prime honey, the super prime stuff 
and the super prime, the best of everything gets 
taken on the set aside for the queen and the 
eggs.
Willow Lance: Okay.
Rebbeca Lance: The worker bees, the drones, everybody, 
there's different tiers and levels of what they 
get to be allowed to have, but apparently they 
can tell the difference between or they have 
special bees that regurgitate better honey. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Ohh, okay. 
Rebbeca Lance: I'm still learning about all that, but yeah. 
So it's really interesting. So for now it's a 
hobby. I'd like to eventually turn it into 
something that we get to sell at farmers markets. 
If it's something we really enjoy and we find 
that we can grow it, then we'll grow it. And turn 
it into something more if there's a higher demand 
for the honey, the one issue that I've heard 
people saying they don't like sending to other 
farms in other states is because you do run the 
risk of losing your bees, they either leave the 
hive or they get infested with something and 
you're not there to monitor it.
Willow Lance: Right, right. 
Rebbeca Lance: So there is a risk involved with sending 
your bees in someone else's care. 
Willow Lance: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
Rebecca Lance: So that's the thing. But apparently, it's 
very lucrative to those that are used to it in 
the sense of whatever this makes money doing. The 
other thing is, is that you get to use it as a 
farm exemption or tax write-off on your property.
Willow Lance: Ohh, okay!
Rebbeca Lance: So when people will have cattle or farm 
animals, farm -- livestock.
Willow Lance: Mhmm. 
Rebbeca Lance: Which you may essentially need 20 acres, or 
30 acres or more acreage because you only allowed 
so many animals per so many acres or whatever, 
where you could put honeybees on your property, 
and now you're done. 
Willow Lance: Yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: And now you get the same -- you get the tax 
exemptions.
Willow Lance: Ohh.
Rebbeca Lance: So for people that own land, it's beneficial 
for that reason alone to have honeybees on their 
property.
Willow Lance: Right, Okay. I did not know that. That's 
cool. Yeah, that's so interesting.
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah.
Willow Lance: So to kind of finish out our interview here, 
I'm just going to ask you kind of some just basic 
general questions about how do you imagine or see 
the future availability of food, specifically 
honey in Texas. Do you have any concerns about 
it? Any opinions? Anything at all like kind of 
the future of food production or you can talk 
specifically about honey?
Rebbeca Lance: Well. I mean. Try to be diplomatic here. I 
mean, I'm a conspiracy foil hat-wearing, you know 
person. So I really think that we need to be very 
careful and tread lightly with how we're 
producing our food. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: What we put in our food, what chemicals 
we're using to preserve our food, And that's one 
of the things I really like about the bees is 
it's just pure.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: It's very simple. It's very natural. It's 
very pure. It's good for you. Now one of the risk 
you run -- it doesn't matter how healthy you 
choose to produce your food or your livestock or 
anything, you run the risk of chemicals that are- 
that people use to keep bugs away --
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: -- to keep things from losing their crops. 
And it gets into the system. It gets into the 
water systems, it soaks into the ground, it soaks 
into our food. It goes -- cycles through the air 
with the rain. So, at some point -- 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: -- I think that we're going to get beyond a 
point of repair with that because it's going to 
be in everything, everywhere. It's going to be 
seeped into everything and the time that it would 
take to make everything pure again. Now the hard 
part is, on the flip side is if they don't use 
that, they can't mass produce.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: Because they run the risk of losing crops 
and they run the risk of not being able to 
provide enough food to the population. And -- or, 
have it last long enough, cause most food you 
know doesn't last as long as it is when it goes 
to the grocery store, right? They've added stuff 
to it to make it last longer. So -- but we don't 
all have local farmers that we can trade with or 
go to or have accessibility to these things. I 
think if more people in the community were 
choosing to try different things like let's say 
you live next door and you did eggs, and then the 
neighbor on the other side of you did tomatoes, 
and the neighbor on the -- I mean, if everybody 
had something that we could all kind of 
interchange maybe.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: If the community or more individuals maybe 
came together, I think that that would be very 
interesting. 
Willow Lance: Right. 
Rebbeca Lance: I love that idea of communities coming 
together and exchanging goods. 
Willow Lance: Yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: Or -- or even selling it to each other, but 
having something that's, you know, fresh and 
immediate -- It tastes different.
Willow Lance: Right, yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: It just it -- it's something that's 
naturally grown in your garden, a tomato will 
taste completely different than a tomato from the 
grocery store. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And you'd be shocked at how different it is. 
Willow Lance: Yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: So I really like that idea. I really hope 
that enough people can come together and make 
that happen. That's my hope for the future.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: But the food industry is a beast -- 
Willow Lance: Yeah, for sure.
Rebbeca Lance: -- and it's going -- it's a freight train, 
and the rest of us are still kind of doing the 
horse and wagon kind of right style, you know, so 
it's definitely hard to compete with. So I'm just 
going to do my little part and, you know I -- 
this -- these bees may abandon me too. 
Willow Lance: [laughs] Yeah.
Rebbeca Lance: [laughs] And I might get infested with moths 
again, and I may lose it all again, and I may be 
completely unsuccessful. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: But I'm not going to stop trying until I've 
just exhausted every opportunity that I can to 
see if I can make it happen because it's 
something that I want.
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And I want to see how far I can take it, and 
it may just be something that I give to friends 
and family and just enjoy with my neighbors, or 
maybe something I grow into a business. 
Willow Lance: Right.
Rebbeca Lance: And we're just, I used to try to make 
everything into "How can I turn this into a 
business?" and this is the first time I said I'm 
going to do this purely because I just want to.
Willow Lance: Right, right.
Rebbeca Lance: So each step I take in the growth of that is 
going to be a personal choice for me. If it's 
something I want to do and if I don't I won't. 
But I think that it's important for people in the 
Community to take these steps. 
Willow Lance: Right, yeah, yeah. Well, thank you so much 
for doing this interview with me today and for 
talking about your bees. I had a lot of fun and I 
learned a lot of things. So, thank you very much.
Rebbeca Lance: Yeah, this was fun!
Willow Lance: Yeah!
Rebbeca Lance: I didn't realize I had to have so much to 
talk about. Well. [laughs]
Willow Lance: [laughs] All right. Well then I guess that is 
the interview. Okay. Well, thank you. Yeah. 
Course.
