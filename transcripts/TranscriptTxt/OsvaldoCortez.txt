Place of Interview: Unknown 



 
Itzel Verdin: Hello, my name is Itzel Verdin, and I will be 
interviewing my tío from my mother's side. And 
can you go ahead and introduce yourself and tell 
us a little bit about yourself?
Osvaldo Cortez: My name is Osvaldo Cortez or Osvaldo Arturo 
Cortez for the full thing. And I am 53 years old. 
I live in Dallas, Texas with my wife and my two 
kids that that also live here and yeah.
Itzel Verdin: Okay. And so, can you tell me when and where 
you were born?
Osvaldo Cortez: I was born in in 1971 in Mexico City. So, 
there was six of us. Four boys and two girls and 
we grew up in Mexico City and moved here when we 
were young.
Itzel Verdin: And in regards to growing up in Mexico, do 
you happen to remember what kinds of food you ate 
growing up? Do you have any memories of that?
Osvaldo Cortez: Oh yeah, there was -- food was a big, big 
part of our life. It was different than here. 
Most of the food that we bought was bought from 
markets, some from stores, but it's just a 
different, you know, you didn't go to Walmart or 
a place like that we bought most of the food that 
we that we got was from the outside markets that 
were that were outside the house where my mom 
would walk and get food and our milk was 
delivered to our house in a glass jar and it was 
all very fresh. Tortillas were picked up daily 
or, you know, a few times a week from the 
tortilleria. She would walk over and pick up 
tortillas from the tortilleria and bread from the 
panaderia. We would walk over and pick up fresh 
bread. And it was all very, very -- It's all 
really very fresh, yeah.
Verdin: Yeah, a lot different from here.
Cortez: Yeah. Even though even though it was the city and 
Mexico City is a big city, it still was just a 
different way of life. And it's not like that 
now, the Walmart's and grocery stores all over 
the place. But back when I was young, it was, you 
know, those, those are those places are still 
around. That markets and stuff? But yeah, that's 
basically how, how I grew up was uh. That kind of 
food and. It was, uh, you know. Always. There was 
always a woman in the kitchen cooking something, 
always. Whether it was my aunt or my mom or a 
cousin. Life revolved around food, and it was -- 
there was there was no such thing as eating out 
the first restaurant I ever ate at was when I 
moved to the United States. I'd never eaten in a 
restaurant. 
Verdin: Oh wow.
Cortez: I'd actually never gone to a building that was an 
actual restaurant that closest thing to a 
restaurant, quote-unquote was if we would pick up 
like the tacos from that, you know, from a stand 
on the streets and stuff, that was as far as food 
that you bought that was not -- that you didn't 
cook at home, everything absolutely every meal, 
365 was home cooked.
Verdin: And I know that you guys had spent a lot of time 
with your tías at their houses. And had a lot of 
mealtimes there, my mom said. Do you remember how 
mealtimes went? Was it different than here?
Cortez: It was, especially if it was just to kind of go and 
visit. You know, food was actually just very 
simple, very simple ingredients. We didn't have a 
lot of money growing up, so. So, it wasn't fancy 
stuff, but man it was really, really, really good 
food. That's kind of why I love, I think the 
restaurant business and why I've been involved in 
it, it's because I would always see my mom and my 
aunts, just cooking all the time. I mean, that's 
just what they did, was. And I would always just 
kind of approach and see it. And I always had an 
interest and a fascination with the kitchen where 
I didn't see any other guys really ever in the 
kitchen. It was just, I would always going to 
walk over. And Mom, what are you doing? Or tía, 
what are you doing? And so, it was different in 
that way. And also, if it was going to be, if we 
went over there because of a family gathering or 
if people were in town or whatever, it was, it 
was really an orchestra of food because there was 
a lot of food that was bought and breakfast was 
started early in the morning, before anybody got 
up and there was usually one or two women getting 
up early, probably by 5:30 or 6:00 start cooking. 
You'd get up and the men would just sit down and 
eat. And there would just be these meals. And 
then as soon as breakfast was over, then 
everything was picked up, dishes started washing, 
and there was no let me take a break from it was 
it was immediately started peeling and prepping 
for lunch. And then the same thing happened after 
lunch, you start picking up and cleaning. And you 
start prepping for dinner. And that was just. And 
it was like that, all year round. So yeah, much 
different.
Verdin: And you said when you first came here, that's when 
you first ate in a restaurant. Do you remember 
which restaurant it was?
Cortez: I don't remember the name of it. My family 
remembers it, I know my dad does. It was in 
Lufkin, Texas because we moved to, when we moved 
here in 1980. The whole family moved here. My mom 
moved here in '79 and worked here for a year. She 
worked in a hotel, as a maid and my uncle Mendoza 
was a professor, at Stephen F Austin in East 
Texas, and my mom came, and my dad had lost his 
job. He'd worked for the latter Commission for, 
for several years. He'd lost his job. So, my mom 
came here for a year and she came back and 
grabbed us in 1980. And well we moved back in 
July, June or July, I think it was July of 1980. 
When we moved and so when we moved to the States. 
And so. One of the things that we did when Dad 
had got a little money was the first time. And it 
was, I guess. It was just it was one of the 
first, American things that we did. Was that we 
knew that we heard that they were saying I don't 
know how we found out about her, maybe my parents 
had friends that eaten there I don't know but at 
the end of the day I just remember it was a 
little Mexican restaurant in downtown Lufkin. And 
we went and we ate, just like Mexican, you know, 
traditional Mexican food because he was, you 
know, pozole. And they had menudo and just and I 
vividly remember it because I remember just the 
restaurant ambience because it was just so 
fascinating to me that you know that my mom or 
sisters or women were not cooking the meal that 
we are actually sitting down as somebody was 
serving us. That was mind blowing to me that we 
just sat down and we sat at a table and food was 
brought to us. Yeah, I can understand that. And 
I'll never forget it too, because they had a 
little video game back then. It was very early in 
the video game era. And so it was a big deal that 
there was a video game. Sitting there, and I just 
remember just having a blast because something -- 
just a restaurant experience with the video game 
there and I'll, I still remember what it looks 
like. I cannot remember the name of it, but it 
was there for many years, it is no longer there. 
But yeah, that was my first restaurant 
experience.
Verdin: That's exciting. Yeah, but again, you mentioned. 
So, when you guys first came here, you mentioned 
that your mother worked at the hotel, and that 
she came back for you guys that following summer. 
So, when you guys moved here that summer, my mom 
has talked a lot about that you guys were living 
on a farm in East Texas, and you guys did labor 
in exchange for food and housing.
Cortez: Basically, that's what it was. It was an exchange. 
We, my parents, quote-unquote, got paid, but they 
were charged. So, when we moved here in 1980, we 
were only -- there was a lot of us. My uncle, my 
Uncle Mendoza and his wife. My Aunt Mimi had 
children and they had a full house. Even though 
their house was a large house, it's still it was 
just a lot of people because we bought, it was 
five kids and mom and dad, so that was seven 
people that added on a house that was already 
like, 11 in that house or something like that. 
So, we're going around close to 20 people in one 
house. And so we were only at my uncle's house 
for about, I think, like a day or two, it was 
very quick. And we, my uncle, my Uncle Mendoza, 
which, you know, he had some connections. Knew of 
a family that that had a farm in Garrison, Texas. 
And they said they'll give you room and board. 
You can have a house there that you can live in. 
You guys can work there, and they'll pay you to 
get to work with chickens to grab the eggs and 
separate the eggs from the from the chicken 
house. And yeah, so we moved, we all packed up 
and moved over there and, but they basically just 
took so much advantage of us. I was a baby. My 
aunt Lili, which is, your mom. We were the two 
youngest ones. And so we for the most part didn't 
do much. She was watching me. She would 
occasionally -- I found out from my dad that she 
would occasionally go to the grocery store with 
our cousin Celia Mendoza, which was my uncle 
Mendoza's daughter. My uncle remembers that, 
because it was during the Summer and so his 
daughter, his kids were out for the summer, so 
they would go with the with the lady to go to the 
grocery store. And I believe that my uncle said 
that she would she pay him like a quarter, to go 
and to help her with the grocery stores, so she 
was paying them. And then my parents were getting 
paid like $30 a day. That included, that was for 
my mom, for my dad. For my, for your tía Moni, 
for my sister Moni, and for my brother Tavo. So, 
for four people it was $30 a day. So, it was 
basically slave labor and they would charge us 
you know rent to live in that house. So, once 
they charged us rent and once with the little 
that we got paid, there was really nothing left 
over. I guess that was my first. You know with 
actually working with food, which I actually 
didn't really work because I was young. I was 
nine years old and so. I'd go to the chicken 
houses and stuff and then see it, but they scared 
me. I was little because they --
Verdin: Yeah.
Cortez: They'd go after you those, especially those 
Roosters. They would mean, they were mean.
Verdin: My mom has told me that you guys would sit on the, 
in the kitchen and you would peel peas.
Cortez: Oh, I forgot about the peas, yeah.
Verdin: A giant sack that the woman would give you guys a 
giant bag of peas.
Cortez: They were actually like sugar snap peas, and we'd 
have to peel them, yeah.
Verdin: Yeah, she says that she remembers that and that she 
would pay you guys a quarter a day for both of 
you guys. I think that's what she said.
Cortez: Yeah. And as well, yeah. And that was her main 
thing was to pay quarters for just little odds 
and ends. But it was pretty traumatic because my 
aunt, my sister Moni, your aunt Moni. She was 
used to, you know, they used her and Tavo, and 
they were both, you know, they were both young, 
you know, they were kids. Moni was in high 
school. I think she was a sophomore in high 
school, and Tavo I believe was a freshman in high 
school. And you know, just working 8 to 10-hour 
days doing that as kids was you know and then 
those chickens were very mean and those Roosters. 
Like I said, would go after. That's basically 
kind of what we're only actually there for I 
think for like a month or two, something like 
that. It wasn't very long because my dad finally, 
one of those Roosters kind of went after your 
aunt and my aunt or my sister Moni. It kind of 
went. It was he was like the Bane Rooster, the 
one that kind of like, would you know? It was 
because of him that all the little, all the 
little chicken girls, you know, all the eggs 
were, you know. And anyways he went after Moni 
very aggressively because they can be very mean, 
very mean and Moni was just petrified and said, 
Dad, dad, this you know, it's like it's what I 
said and he's trying, you know, calm her down. 
She's like, no, he's very mean. And he's been 
doing it for a while and I can't get him to stop, 
you know, and I think he heard Moni. And so, my 
dad, you know, just got upset and went after the 
rooster. Just kinda like screaming at him, you 
know, trying to get him to stop, well the man, 
the owner of the ranch, saw my dad and got onto 
my dad. 'No, you can't do that to him. He's my 
he's our main one is because of him that. That 
we've got, you know, business,' and blah blah. 
And so immediately that's when my dad called my 
Uncle Mendoza and said, no, this is not working 
out. We can't as it is. We're not making any 
money. And then you know, and my kids are my kids 
are being, you know, they're being taken 
advantage of. I know. I know one story that my 
dad told me. I just found this out real recently 
that your uncle, your uncle Tavo. You know, 
chickens, would chickens and hens would you know, 
they die on the property. And so that he made, 
the man made Tavo go around with a with like a 
wheelbarrow and collect all the dead chickens 
and. And so that was kind of traumatizing for 
Tavo because then you would you did, you'd have 
you know crows going around and you know, 
hovering over it and it's just it just it was 
very, it was very traumatic for Tavo, you know, 
and so. So, we did not last there very long. We 
went back to my uncle's house for a little while, 
and we actually lived in the hotel. And I 
remember this, we actually lived in the hotel 
for, I don't remember the time limit, but I want 
to say anywhere between 3 days and the weeks, 
something like that until we could try to find, 
you know, somewhere to live and. And my Uncle 
Mendoza helped my mom and dad try to find the 
trailer. Where they -- Mom and Dad still live to 
this day. So, they bought the trailer and yeah, 
it was, you know, it was very -- there's a lot of 
things that we went through that that you know 
most you know. Most kids don't go through, yeah.
Verdin: Yes, I know, my mom recently told me about how when 
you guys left the farm, you had to kind of sneak 
off in a truck in the middle of the night.
Cortez: Yeah. No, we went -- Because the man he was very 
mean. He did not want us to leave. And because he 
had free slave labor, you know, basically it's.
Verdin: Yeah.
Cortez: Is what it amounted down to it because even though 
he was paying us, but then he was paying us for 
rent. So, at the end of the day, he really wasn't 
paying much for anything. He was just, you know.
Verdin: Indentured servitude.
Cortez: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, yeah. No, we had to. We 
had to basically run away.
Verdin: After you guys left the farm, do you remember what 
your parents did for work after that?
Cortez: I was the youngest one. I want to say the first 
thing. Yeah, I'm like 100% positive that the very 
first thing -- So, my Uncle Mendoza was a 
professor at Stephen F Austin. He was very 
involved with the church, devout Catholic and so, 
Sacred Heart Catholic Church Nacogdoches. He knew 
that there was a lady that -- the same lady that 
that owned Continental Inn was Pollock. She had 
hired my mom the year before 1979 to be a maid. 
Well, my mom had left it to go work at, you know, 
at the ranch. And so, when we came back, my Uncle 
Mendoza just asked Miss Pollock, like, 'hey could 
she have her job back?' She's like, 'let me check 
and see. I think, you know, we hired somebody 
else. But let me just check and see.' And so I 
think the lady that they had hired that wasn't 
working out. So, they ended up, you know, 
bringing my mom back in. So, she got her job 
back. And my dad, you know, Mom and Dad didn't 
know any English. So, there's, you know. And it's 
a different world back then this is a small-town 
East Texas. It's not like it is now where you can 
find TV in Spanish anywhere you can find that 
pretty much any store that you can go to now. 
Even if you don't speak English. You can go to 
just about any store now and find somebody that 
speaks Spanish on the phone who picks, pick up 
the phone and somebody. There's bilingual. It's 
just that's not a problem today. Back then it was 
a problem. There was, you know. And so, when 
simple daily tasks that you have to try to do to 
get it to get around it and be able to survive 
and do things. It was just a huge hurdle because 
they didn't, because of the English. So, they 
asked Miss Pollock like 'what about my dad?' 
She's like 'I don't really have anything for 
him.' And so, she talked to Dad and said what can 
you do? And he said, he lied, because he really 
didn't have too much skills and he goes, 'I can 
do anything well, you know, you name it I can do 
it all.' And so, he started just kind of telling 
her just to try to get a position. And she goes, 
'oh okay. Well, you're going to start by sweeping 
the streets of the hotel, the parking lot. And, 
you know, so little, odds and ends job. So that's 
basically how my dad -- And so he made himself 
useful. He started by doing that by cleaning the 
parking lot of the hotel. My mom got back to 
cleaning and being the maid and then Dad. That 
was like I said, made himself useful as much as 
he could in Miss Pollock's house. Doing different 
things got an odd thing helping her out. Helping 
them all the maids in the hotel helping them, 
bringing back and forth stuff of clothes and 
loads of the sheets and stuff, just anything that 
he can kind of do to so she wouldn't say no. 
Sorry. You know. So that's how that happened. And 
then but then we still weren't making it because 
we have that trailer payment. So, mom and dad 
actually got two other jobs, so at least at one 
time they were I know they were working two jobs. 
I believe at one time they were working three 
jobs. And so, my Aunt Moni, basically because she 
was the oldest female. She was basically the mom 
of the house. She was the one that was having to 
clean and cook and you know, and do those kinds 
of things and. And Lili and your Aunt Lili just 
wasn't. She's never really been to a kitchen 
person, so cooking or anything that was just not 
her.
Verdin: Oh, I know.
Cortez: And so and then Lili's very strong headed. So, it 
was basically left to Moni to kind of the 
responsibilities of taking care of us while Mom 
and Dad were working all the time day and night. 
Yeah.
Verdin: I was going to ask you about that. Yes. So, I was 
going to ask from moving from Mexico City to 
Nacogdoches, Texas in the '80s where like you 
said there wasn't a Mexican market on every 
corner. There wasn't people who spoke Spanish. 
So, your culture wasn't really accessible to you 
in those -- 
Cortez: At all.
Verdin: Yes, in those terms. So, I was going to ask in 
regards to diet. And just in general, how 
mealtimes changed during that time?
Cortez: It was incredibly hard, because the girls -- we 
didn't have a car. So, when we bought the 
trailer, and we got set in the trailer park in on 
Pearl St. in Nacogdoches. And so without having a 
car access because we just didn't have the money. 
The only way we could feed ourselves was to walk 
to Kroger, to go pick up groceries. It was either 
that or it was almost the same distance to go to 
like a little food Mart, you know, kind of gas 
station where you can kind of find. But there's 
really no food there. It's just stuff, junk. So, 
we had to walk to Kroger. We would have to walk 
over there and then with all the groceries we'd 
have to carry them back. And it's just. I want to 
say it's like about two and a half, three miles. 
So, carrying and all that in your hands. It's 
just it's very, very heavy, milk, and all that. 
And I was little so I could only carry so much. 
So, especially my dad because he was, you know, 
he was the oldest and the strongest. He was the 
one having to carry most of it or time or whoever 
was able to go but, but I was so little I would 
kind of slow them down. So, most of the time that 
they go on those walks to the grocery store, it 
was my dad really, most of the time because Mom 
would stay home. And you know, if there was a day 
that they were off, that's when there's only time 
they would go to the grocery store. If it was a 
Sunday where they were off and that was another 
huge culture shock because East Texas 
Nacogdoches, 1980 I still vividly remember this, 
there was only about three items that you could 
get that were "Mexican." And that was beans, 
canned and sometimes you get them in the, you 
know, whole beans where you had to cook them. It 
was beans, rice, and tortillas, and tortillas 
were hit or miss. Cilantro took probably another 
year or two for cilantro to kind of come into 
play, but there was no there was just nothing 
from our culture that we could buy at all. And 
so, it was all having to cook and eat American 
style. And cooking the best we could to try to 
replicate how we grew up and it was not close.
Verdin: And would you say that that's something that 
affected the way you approached your future life 
and your career?
Cortez: It affected me in the way that I saw Mom, and 
that's the way I took to this day. That's the way 
I took to this day is that I saw Mom make meals 
with very little, with what was in the pantry 
with having to modify things to go with 1, a low 
budget, a small budget, and 2, very small 
selection for the kind of foods that we were used 
to, the kind of vegetables that we were used to, 
the freshness that we're used to. And so, seeing 
Mom do that affected me because I could see her 
doing that and it was impressive to me. It was 
something that affected me in the way that I cook 
now because to this day that's kind of how I cook 
I don't cook with a recipe I just grab what's in 
the pantry and I can make a meal pretty much out 
of anything with very little ingredients and make 
it taste pretty good with not much, yeah.
Verdin: With what you got.
Cortes: Yeah. 
Verdin: And growing up in Nacogdoches, I know that you guys 
were one of the very few Mexican families there, 
especially in the '80s. Would you say it was hard 
to keep your culture up in this time because 
everything was new, and it was foreign to you? 
Would you say that it was hard to keep it alive? 
So to say.
Cortez: It was extremely hard to keep it alive because 
there was very few families for that kind of -- 
Little by little, over the years, more families 
started kind of moving in, so that made it easier 
and so as families were starting to come in, then 
-- because that would, there would be Spanish 
mass at Sacred Heart, but a lot those families we 
didn't know them but they lived in different 
areas. And so, you know and so we started 
becoming kind of friends with some of those 
families so that helped a little in the culture 
part of it. But Mom and Dad were not huge, like 
social people as far as, 'hey, come on over,' 
because they just were not big drinkers or big 
partiers. 'Hey, come on over. We're going to do a 
carne asada and bring the beer.' It's just that's 
not the way I grew up. I didn't grow up like 
that. The culture of what we had as far as music 
and TV and being around people, friends, and 
family, that was a massive, massive change 
because how I grew up in Mexico City, everybody 
was outside. Nobody was inside. You knew all your 
neighbors. You walked everywhere and so you got 
to know people. And then coming to the US, where 
there was fences, and houses were far apart and 
you didn't know your neighbor, who your neighbor 
was. And if you said hi, it was. It's just that 
and everything was so spread out. And if you need 
to go somewhere you have to have a car. That was 
foreign to us because everything we did in Mexico 
scene was all public transportation was either a 
passet or a taxi or a metro. Or, you know, it 
was, you can get around by doing that without, 
you know, very few people had a car, you know, we 
didn't have -- You know, I think my uncle had a 
car. And then there was something. And we were 
big family. There was only two cars in the whole 
family. It was just something you just didn't -- 
It was not required. So, That was a big culture 
shock in coming to the US and not and not being 
able to get anywhere unless you owned a car and 
not being able to talk to somebody because 
neighbors would kind of close the door, they come 
home from work and they shut the door and they 
had fenced in yard. It was just different and so. 
And so yeah, as far as culture that was huge. And 
again, like I said, it's not you know if we 
wanted Mexican music, you either owned the 
cassette or you owned an album. That's the only 
way you listen to Mexican music. There was no 
Internet where you can kind of -- And then if you 
turn on TV, you had to have a satellite dish to 
be able to get something from Mexico, from 
Mexico. That was the only way you could catch any 
TV from Mexico or any TV in Spanish. And unless 
you live close to Houston, maybe there'd be 
something, we'd get a little bit of that. I think 
we get one channel from the Houston area because 
Nacogdoches gets some of the Houston channels. 
And so, I think we would get one channel in 
Spanish, and so that's all Mom and Dad could 
watch and but I want to say that took a while. 
That wasn't initially either. So, all those were 
things that kind of helped or hindered our 
ability to be able to live out our culture and 
besides and everybody that I went to school with 
spoke English. They were all American. And so, I 
didn't have anybody to kind of relate with that. 
I had to be able to speak to anybody. And my dad 
just recently told me that he came by and because 
I just thought because I asked him, you know, I 
asked him a question and he said I went to -- one 
day I was at work at the hotel and Miss Pollock 
said Valdo's sick. He was like, okay. And he knew 
she never. It was early on. It was like the first 
few months. You know, when school started back. 
So we got here in the summer. As soon as school 
started back. I don't know if it was a month in 
or how long it was, but. Dad is like I gotta go 
pick up Valdo and then, you know, at this time we 
had just got a car. We had just gotten an old 
beat-up clunker car. That was hit or miss whether 
it would go a mile or two, you know, we'd call it 
the cucaracha. And because it was just this old 
white, I think, I think Dad paid like $200 for 
it. And I think they should have paid us to take 
it over because it was horrible. Anyways, and it 
was, he went and got in the car and he came and 
picked me up and it was because I'd had an 
anxiety attack and I'd thrown up because of 
nervousness of being in the school where I didn't 
know anybody. I didn't speak the language. I was 
just, you know, I was just scared. And so they 
take me to the hotel and I just stayed there with 
them. For the day.
Verdin: So that was another question that I was going to 
ask you was, I know for my generation, just 
personally, that my generation is full of a lot 
of first generation kids, a lot of children of 
immigrants and even with us being born and raised 
in America. We're still bullied if we bring our 
cultural foods to school, like, oh, that smells 
weird. That looks weird. You're weird, was that 
something that you sort of felt in a way? I know 
it's not the same.
Cortez: Oh, I used to get made fun of all the time because, 
it's part of the culture, like I told you in in 
Mexico, you don't go eat out, you don't buy, you 
know, now there's like, lunchables and stuff like 
that. But even back then, there were foods for 
kids that you could kind of buy for, you know, 
and kids would eat certain kinds of foods in the, 
in the cafeteria. I was the only one that had a 
container with home-made food from Mom. I was 
brutally made fun of and laughed at for those 
kinds of foods and I was very shy when I was 
young. I'm not shy now, but when I was little I 
was extremely shy and so that was just. I didn't 
understand why kids made fun of the fact that I 
just had food. It's just food. What's the big 
deal? But not only one, was it homemade, which is 
something that nobody did, but it was also, it 
was also Mexican, you know, home-made. And so 
yes, the same thing that you went through, I went 
through as well because I would get, I would get 
comments on that like that, you know. food as a...
Verdin: Food as a source of isolation? 
Cortez: Yes. No. Yeah, exactly.
Verdin: And then moving forward as a teenager, I know that 
your brother's like tío Tavo, and them, they 
worked in the Mexican restaurant in town. Once 
you guys got a Mexican restaurant. And I 
remember, I think my mother mentioned that you 
were a dishwasher I believe or?
Cortez: No. So basically this restaurant you're talking 
about is called Casa Tomas. And uh, Casa Tomas 
you can call it a Mexican restaurant, but it's a 
Tex Mex restaurant. You know, there's really 
nothing Mexican about it. I mean, except for the 
rice and beans. But even those are Tex-Mex 
there's a difference and so basically that 
restaurant played a huge role in our families, 
journey through being in Nacogdoches. Because 
that restaurant actually, my dad has worked at -- 
Did you ask what kind of job? And then remember I 
told you they had like 3 jobs at one time. Mom 
worked there for a time, very short time. My mom 
worked there for a time. My dad, your tío Cefe, 
your tío Cefe, my dad has worked there. Cousins. 
My brother Tavo, Lacho, Temo. A lot of people 
have run through that, went through that 
restaurant. And so that was really probably my 
introduction into the restaurant business is that 
my brother Tavo got a job there as a server, no 
as a bus -- he got there as job there as a busboy 
initially. When he was little, when he was young 
and in Casa Tomas. And then he eventually became 
a server very quickly after that, he became a 
server. And so, once Tavo started working there 
because like I said, my different cousins have 
worked in there. Whatever, it was just kind of a 
natural fit for me to, when it was time for me to 
start my first job because I'm very independent. 
I do think I've always been very independent in 
what I do, and one of the things that I that I 
wanted to do was have a car. So, I started, so I 
wanted to start working. The only way I could 
afford to buy a car, my, mom and dad weren't 
going to be able to pay for my car. Mom and Dad 
were not to be able to pay for my insurance. Mom 
and Dad were not going to be able to pay for 
drivers ed. If I wanted any of that, I had to 
work. So, I spoke to Gary, which was Gary Gibbs 
was married to my cousin Anita Gibbs, which is 
Anita's, my uncle Mendoza's daughter. And I think 
Tavo, actually Tavo asked, Gary, 'hey listen 
Gary, you know my little brother wants to come on 
you know, can he come on?' And so, he said sure, 
I'll bring him on as the busboy. I was 15, it was 
actually illegal. You have to be 16. So, I've 
been in the restaurant business since I was 15. 
On and off, mostly on. There's been a year here 
or a year there, but it's close to 40 years of 
being in the restaurant business. And so I came 
on as a bus boy there and was a busser there and 
then just like Tavo, my brother, I became a 
server. I was up to the server there and at the 
time that I was a server, my brother Temo was a 
bartender. Tavo was serving, waiting tables 
there. My brother Lacho was waiting tables there. 
My cousin Anita was there as a Hostess, and I 
talked to her as I talked your Hostess. And so 
yeah, that's kind of what got me into the into 
the restaurant business was Casa Tomas.
Verdin: Oh wow. Are there any memories from Casa Tomas that 
really stick out to you?
Cortez: The smells. This was one was probably one of the 
bigger -- One I loved, and to this day people ask 
me, you know you've been in it for so long. I 
honestly, honestly, truly do love the industry. 
I'm a people person. I've told you I was very 
shy. I was very shy. My whole life when I was 
younger, but once I kind of got a little bit more 
self-confident and started kind of just learning 
the language and just being, you know, a little 
bit more, you know? Got comfortable in my own 
skin, I was able to, you know, to kind of break 
out of that. And working in the restaurant, 
having a job helped me to kind of break out of 
out of that shyness and talking to people and, 
you know, kind of seeing how people interact and 
how servers interacted and how bartenders 
interacted in the kitchen and all that. And it's 
always lively. The restaurant business is very, 
very, very hard, very fast paced. And I enjoy 
that. I enjoyed the kind of hustle and bustle of 
going and blowing. And then before you know it, 
hey the shifts over and then everyone would just 
going to get out together afterwards. And then 
that's kind of what happened. We would get 
together afterwards. And you know, once I became 
the server and we'd have beers and go here and go 
there. And it's just it's just kind of a 
lifestyle. That kind of draws you in and but me, 
being a people person, I enjoy talking to people. 
I enjoy finding out about people's lives and you 
know, you know, how are you doing and that kind 
of thing. And I honestly think that, you know, 
part of it obviously is to try to make money and 
if you know a lot of a lot of my experience has 
been -- I've done I've done it all but a lot of 
it has been as a server and finding out the -- 
Talking to people. Learning how to talk to people 
at Casa Tomas has helped me through my journey 
and everything that I've done in my life. In all 
positions, in other positions that I've done. In 
friendships, in my relationship with my wife, in 
my relationship with my kids, all that started 
with Casa Tomas and the restaurant business and 
really getting used to talking to people, asking 
questions, learning how to listen, finding out 
about some people's lives and. And that was the 
thing of, I think it was big. They informed me a 
lot and he taught me a lot on how to relate to 
people and how to and how to build friendships.
Verdin: And --
Cortez: So, I don't know if I really answered the question, 
so my apologies. 
Verdin: No yeah, you said the smells. But that was very --
Cortez: Yeah, sorry. But basically I guess what I'll say 
about the smell is because Casa Tomas, it was Tex 
Mex. And there's certain just like if you were to 
go let's say, let's say if you were working in a 
seafood place. Obviously, your clothes would 
smell like seafood, right? Well, there was a 
certain smell to Casa Tomas, that you can ask the 
hundreds or even thousands of people that have 
gone, because it's no longer around, that have 
worked in that place and if you ask them, I'm 
telling you, let's just say 1000 people don't 
know if there's been 1000 people that have worked 
there. But if you were to ask those thousand 
people, what's the one thing you remember, about 
Casa Tomas. I would probably tell you that 995 of 
them would say that smell. That you couldn't get 
out of your clothes. You could not get that smell 
of chips and salsa and beans. And if there's just 
a Tex-Mex smell, that that not only soaked into 
your clothes, it soaked into like the pores of 
your skin, you could, and in your hair, you 
couldn't get, even after you showered and the 
next day you're like, oh, still smell like Casa. 
That was like, and I'm telling you, if you ask 
anybody that's, that's why I said that 
immediately because that's the one thing that I 
will never, ever ever forget about that Casa 
smell.
Verdin: Nice. I remember tío Temo coming home and smelling 
like --
Cortez: You know that smell that I'm talking about!
Verdin: Yep, I would go up and I would run and hug him, I'd 
say, hmm. I'm gonna back away now. Yeah.
Cortez: You know that smell and it's and it's just, it's 
just and it was so strong and you couldn't get 
rid of it unless you burned the clothes or got 
rid of them. That's the only way you were gonna 
get rid of that smell. It was horrific
Verdin: Yeah, I gotta ask tío Tavo now and see what he 
says, but.
Cortez: But ask him ask ask tío Tavo and see what he 
remembers about Casa. And I promise he's going to 
say the smell. Now I don't know where he's going 
to rank it, but it's going to be there.
Verdin: Yep.
Cortez: If not the first thing. Yeah.
Verdin: And then, later on in your adult life, you moved to 
the DFW area, where you are now, and you became a 
chef over here. What was that like? That move?
Cortez: Well, it was actually just, I don't want to make it 
too long of a story, but I got a degree in 
graphic design. Like I said, I've been in the 
restaurant business most of my life, but there 
was a spell here, and so I got a degree in 
graphic design. And so, the reason I moved to 
Dallas is because I got a job as a graphic artist 
for a for a magazine here, in in Lakewood. Called 
"The Advocate" and then to get to become the 
graphic artist. And so, I did graphic design 
there. For a little while and but I stopped. I 
stopped doing that because very long story, I 
don't want to get into it, but it basically had 
to do with my son Christian. The fact that my 
daughter -- my wife was a teacher, had been a 
teacher. But she left teaching so she could -- 
and she was going to stay home with Christian, I 
was going to be working as a graphic artist, but 
it's when you're straight out of school, 
especially out of graphic design. They pay you 
peanuts, pay you nothing. Nothing that a single 
20 something year old person could live on. 
Especially nothing that a single 20 something 
year old can live on and support a wife and a 
kid. It was just wasn't -- We're not making it. 
My wife was working. My wife Susan was working in 
a daycare for my where she was taking Christian 
and she was getting sick all the time because he 
was getting sick. Because it's a daycare. So 
anyways, long story short, I left graphic design 
because. We didn't want the only thing we had 
options of Susan going back to teaching and then 
I stay as a graphic artist during the day. But 
then Christian would have to be in daycare, and 
we were not. We didn't have any family here in 
Dallas to be able to drop them off at the you 
know a family, let's say my mom. But nobody could 
watch him. We didn't have anybody here, so it was 
either us watching them or we would have to take 
them to daycare or get a nanny. Nanny, we 
couldn't afford. Daycare, we couldn't afford 
either. But especially, and we just didn't trust 
anybody to take care of Christian. So that I did 
the natural thing. Susan went back to teaching. 
My wife went back to teaching. And I went back to 
the restaurant business. So that way she could 
work during the day. And then as soon as she came 
home from teaching, I would already be ready 
dressed to work. And basically, I would just tell 
her about his day because I was basically a stay-
at-home Dad during the day when he was young for 
many years. I would just tell her-- because back 
then there was no cell phone, so I would just 
tell her, tell her about the day, what he was 
doing, what he ate and good day, bad day, 
whatever. What happened during the day took him 
to the park, whatever and then. And so, I was 
working in Lakewood and I got a job at the and a 
Mexican restaurant in the in Dallas called Nuevo 
Leon, I got the job there as a server and then I 
was a part-time assistant manager there for a 
little while, but then the place burned down. 
Nuevo Leon burned down. And so, from there I went 
to Texas Land and Cattle, which is a steakhouse, 
and I worked for that company for 7 years as a 
server. And I did that for a long time. Again, 
Susan working and me taking care of Christian 
during the day and then she'd come home. You 
know, we did that song and dance for a long. We 
were kind of ships that pass in the night. We 
really never saw each other except on the 
weekends. We would never see each other. I mean, 
we'd see each other when we it was a drop off. 
You know come do the handoff. Like in track and 
field. Here's the baton boom. And here's the baby 
and. So, the restaurant business has been good to 
me in that way that it could afford me the fact 
that I could stay home with my son and not have 
to worry about anybody else watching him or 
hurting him. And my wife being able to go back to 
school. There was very other little industries 
where I could go in. Work for about four or five 
hours and make the kind of money that I could 
make. As opposed to maybe, let's say, work a 
night shift at a factory. Where I would maybe go 
in at 8:00 PM and come home at you know, 6:00 AM 
or whatever. That wasn't going to work for us 
because then my wife would get up in the morning 
and go to work, and then I'd be dead to the world 
and not being able to take care of Christian so I 
could, the restaurant business afforded me that 
the opportunity to be able to work at night, make 
good money in a short amount of time and so 
basically all that kind of led to the fact that I 
left Texas Land and Cattle. And then I started 
working at a Silver Fox Steakhouse, as a server, 
again as a server. So, I was only there as a 
server for about a year and a half, two years, 
and then they offered me the position and said if 
I would be interested to go into as a manager and 
also a chef in the kitchen and that's basically 
how that career started but. But yeah, can I just 
keep going. Is that good? 
Verdin: No yeah, yeah.
Cortez: Okay, so, so. So basically, what happened there is 
I got a job as a server at Silver Fox Steak 
House. It's fine dining. I've never done fine 
dining before. Even better money than working, 
you know, even at Texas Land and Cattle where 
there were steaks, which is better money, because 
the more the more money they spend, the more 
money tips you make. And so, I did. I had a taste 
of that and taste of that at Texas Land and 
Cattle. So, when I finally got this job at Silver 
Fox I was like, ooh steaks, more money, better, 
good work, so I did that and so when they offered 
me the position. And they said, 'do you know 
anything about the kitchen?' I was like, 
'actually, I cook every day of my life. I've been 
cooking my whole, you know, I just. It was 
something that always interested me in my I 
always wanted to. I always wanted to work or. I 
love cooking.' It was not a problem. And they're 
like, you know, 'do you feel comfortable in the 
kitchen?' I was like, 'actually, I feel very 
comfortable in the kitchen. I'm okay with that.' 
So I got a job as the AGM, the assistant general 
manager of Silver Fox Steakhouse in Richardson 
and then also I was the chef in the back, not 
executive chef because I had Ceaser as my 
executive chef. But I was one of the few people, 
actually probably to this day. Still probably to 
this day that I could really do anything in the 
front or back. Yeah. So, I was fully trained to 
be front of the House manager, inventory, 
schedules. Anything that had to do with front of 
the house and dealing with guests and everything 
that has to do with being in front of the House 
manager. But I could also do everything in the 
back of the house. You know? And so, I did both. 
You know, sometimes I will be front of the House 
manager. Sometimes I will be in the back as a 
chef and in the kitchen. Most of the time I was 
in the kitchen cause that's really where they 
kind of needed me. And so that was an amazing 
experience because I learned a lot. I knew how to 
cook already, but I don't know about different 
techniques. I learned a lot about the food, 
things that I already knew, but things that that 
I didn't know. I learned how to do food orders 
and how to do a food cost, and it was just 
interesting and fascinating to work on the other 
side of the restaurant industry where I was, I 
was mostly working as a server, you know, going 
in, putting orders and then just seeing it from 
that end. But seeing it from the other end and 
seeing, seeing kind of how the other half lives, 
I guess you could say. I will tell you that both 
are very rewarding. Both, I probably had more fun 
in the kitchen as far as just fun to be able to 
enjoy and cooking because I love cooking. I enjoy 
doing that, especially if we would have, like 
chefs' dinners and I would come up with a recipe 
or come up with things to cook for somebody that, 
that again, I can cook on the fly and I can cook 
things, and somebody would come in and go. Hey, 
I've got a vegan. So, I came up with a with a 
vegan appetizer, vegan entree, and vegan dessert. 
Literally in about 45 seconds. It's you had no 
choice, you know. And so, that I enjoy it, you 
know, and then it pushes you.
Verdin: Just on the spot. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Cortez: Just like this is the VIP and we need it. It's 
like, okay, well, let's see. And then I came up 
with a recipe of coconut crusted shrimp. Again, 
it was all just from my head that there was no 
book. It was just from years of experience of 
cooking at home and watching my mom cooking, 
watching my aunts cook and seeing all that. And I 
think there's just there's not only that, but 
there's also, it's a natural knack that I've got. 
That I didn't go to culinary school, but there's 
certain things that I know that spices go, when 
certain amounts go, when certain techniques go, 
that nobody, some were taught, and some are just 
I just know. I don't know how I can explain it 
other than I just know when to turn it or when to 
sauté it. And when to do certain things, and it 
just comes very naturally to me. And so, I 
enjoyed doing that. But I will tell you hands 
down without question, and I've done a lot of 
things in the restaurant business. I've been 
dishwasher, I've been a server. I've been a 
bartender. I've been a chef. You know, for the 
house manager, all that stuff. Nothing is harder 
than work in the kitchen, physically. Nothing, 
not even close. It was. It was exhausting. And 
especially being the manager, there was just a 
lot of hours and a lot of prep and a lot of 
things that people don't realize that go on, in 
order for the show to kind of go on.
Verdin: Mhm.
Cortez: And many hours that I was there cooking and baking 
and prepping and doing things and then especially 
like on holidays. Because we, being a steakhouse, 
we opened every Thanksgiving. That's I think in 
the last in the last like 15 years last over the 
last 20 years because I've been I was gone for a 
couple years. So, in the last 20 years. I think I 
spent. Well, COVID happened, but so let's not 
count COVID if you don't count COVID, I think I'd 
spend one Thanksgiving with my family, like in 17 
years, because I worked every Thanksgiving. You 
know Christmas Eve. I would come home, and it was 
there was no Christmas Eve because I was working 
and I'd come home and everybody was already 
asleep. And everybody you know. And I know when I 
would call home and everybody was kind of getting 
together and having fun and hey, we're hugging 
and I'm like, I'm dead to the world. I just came 
home and I'm exhausted, you know? So, there's a 
lot of sacrifices. That come from working in the 
restaurant and I tell -- we have a lot of kids 
come through the restaurant business that I've 
worked, like let's say in the culinary program of 
their high school something like that. Or they're 
going to school, you know, to a junior college 
and they're in the culinary program and they want 
to come in and or even kids that will, that will 
come into the restaurant. 'Hey, I want to be a 
chef.' I don't ever want to put them down. I tell 
them how exciting and how great it is, but I also 
give them the reality of what it entails of being 
in the kitchen and what you know it's not cute 
and whatever. Like what you see on TV? 
Verdin: Two sides of every coin.
Cortez: Yeah, it's very demanding and very time consuming 
and just know that if you enjoy holidays don't 
get in the restaurant business, yeah.
Verdin: Well, is there anything else that you'd like to 
share? Any experiences, emotions, memories?
Cortez: Oh my gosh, I've got so many I wish. I wish I 
could. I've got so many I met so many friends 
through the through the restaurant business. I 
mean, I've seen everything from -- I mean, just 
craziness like crazy Mexican guy dishwasher that 
was going to kill somebody with a knife because 
that's where he came from. Yeah. And Victor 
Machado was a server and he was -- Victor was 
very strong and very built, but he missed. He 
came across a dishwasher that was from Mexico. 
That was from the streets. And this boy, this guy 
didn't play. And so, he got, like, the butcher 
knife ready to kill him, like, not playing 
around. And we're like, whoa, dude. Yeah. So, 
things like that that I'll never forget to. To 
the fact that the --
Verdin: Yeah.
Cortez: One of my greatest experiences, I love it because 
I'm a foodie and I'm a big, huge restaurant -- 
and I've always loved it. And I remember I was a 
server in Austin in a in a place called, Jalisco. 
I was a server there and I became a manager there 
for a little while too and but anyways I was a 
server there at the time and I got a call and 
they said. Hey, listen, there's some guy on the 
phone. He's coming over and he says he's, you 
know, he's coming in a limo or whatever and but I 
don't know who he is, but he wants to come 
inside. Anyways, he's telling me all this stuff 
and I'm like, well, who is this guy? I don't 
know. So I get on the phone. I'm like, I'm sorry, 
who are you trying to bring? I mean, nobody knew 
him. Nobody in the kitchen. Nobody. But I did -- 
But you probably don't know, a lot of people 
still don't know, but he's basically one of the 
original -- Now you've got like, you know, 
celebrity chefs, your Gordon Ramseys. And you 
know, they're all over the place. Back then, you 
know, he's like one of the original celebrity 
chefs. But before TV and any of that, his name is 
Paul Prudhomme and Paul Prudhomme is basically he 
is a legend in Louisiana cooking. He invented 
blackening and he's you know. And if you've ever 
seen him very famous, big old fat. Anyways, Paul 
Prudhomme. So, I'm like, freaking like, going 
like Paul Prudhomme! So, I was so excited, so 
Paul Prudhomme came in and I waited on him and he 
wanted to try everything in the restaurant. And I 
was like, just like, just going goo goo and 
everybody was like, 'I don't know who this dude 
is.' So, things like that that. That things like 
that will always stick in my mind in the, you 
know, working in the working in the restaurant 
that that I think has you know. Well, I will 
never forget, and you know, and it's funny 
because, you know my daughter has worked in the 
restaurant and as a server and as a Hostess, not 
for her. I don't think it's not. She's done it a 
few times, but she's not, you know. Sophie she's 
not going to continue restaurant. It's a little 
too hard, too much for her and it's very hard, 
very demanding, very stressful and. And if you 
don't, it takes a certain skill set. It takes a 
certain kind of person to be able to do it, and 
if you don't have it, you kind of know it. My 
wife was working in a restaurant for a little 
while, and that was just nuts. She just she left 
because she just she was like, Nope, can't do it. 
My son has been a server, has been a host and the 
server he's got a kind of knack for it. He's 
teaching now. But he's, you know, he's got a 
knack for it and he can kind of handle it so 
that. I guess one of the biggest things about it, 
about the industry, is that it has afforded me 
the ability to be able to raise my son and my 
daughter because I did both to be a stay-at-home 
Dad. But it was different because the stay-at-
home Dad position that I did when I did with 
them. It was different because I would kind of go 
to play groups with other stay at home dads. But 
it was different because all the other stay home 
dads, their mom, their wives were CEO's and 
doctors and lawyers. That's why they were staying 
at home. Because they, you know, I was staying at 
home just because I didn't want, you know, it was 
a different and so I didn't quite fit into that 
into that group. But it had afforded me the 
ability to be able to do that and to be able to 
raise my kids. And for my son and my daughter. To 
have the same level of care with me, as they did 
with their mom. Most of the kids are growing up, 
especially if they've got if they've got the Mom, 
that's raised them. They're really close to their 
mom, and they're close to me. They're really 
close to their mom too. But the ability or the 
gift to be able to spend the same amount of time. 
It was truly 50/50, when Susan and I raised our 
kids because, you know, I was with them for so 
many hours during the day, and changing the 
diapers, and feeding them lunches, and feeding 
them breakfast, and watching videos, and going to 
the park, and go to the Children's Museum. And 
doing other things and all there was just moms 
all around me. And then if I did a group with a 
stay-at-home Dad, I didn't feel that. But it 
didn't matter. The matter of the fact is that I 
was with them. We knew they were going to be 
safe. And then I knew that she. So, Susan knew 
that when I was at home with them, they were 
going to be fine and I knew that when I was at 
the restaurant they were going to be fine because 
they were with mom, with their mom. But the great 
thing about it is that that that, that again, 
especially as a server I could stay there for a 
short period of time and go in at 4:00 or 5:00 be 
home by 10:30 and make more money than I would 
have made from, you know, working two shifts at 
a, you know, at a plant or something. So that 
that's one of the things that I that I probably 
enjoy the most about the restaurant business, is 
that it's afforded me the ability to do that and 
to put both of my kids through college and to, 
you know, have this house and it's just a lot of 
things that it's afforded me to do. It's very 
hard physically. I am just shot because of the 
industry, my feet are gone, my knees are gone, my 
shoulders are gone. But, and I'm still in it. I'm 
still serving. I'm still a server in my 50s. But 
I do it, I do it because I think, you know, I'm 
pretty good at it and I and I love it.
00:55:36 Verdin: All right. Well, thank you so much for 
taking the time and energy to talk to me.
Cortez: You're welcome.
Verdin: I know that we talked about a lot of stuff, that, 
you know, very emotional periods of your life, 
very traumatic periods of your life. So I really 
appreciate you being open and talking about those 
with me.
Cortez: No problem.
Verdin: Yes. So, thank you very much.
Cortez: You're so welcome. It's my pleasure.
