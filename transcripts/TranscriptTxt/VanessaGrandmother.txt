Vanessa Lingenfelter's Grandmother (Name Unknown)



Interviewer: Vanessa Lingenfelter  Date: March 14th, 2024
 
Place of Interview: Unknown
    



Vanessa Lingenfelter: OK. So, how are you?
Vanessa Lingenfelter's Grandmother: Good! And you?
Vanessa Lingenfelter: I'm good. 
Vanessa Lingenfelter's Grandmother: That's good.
Vanessa Lingenfelter: So, I want to start by just asking 
you to give a brief explanation of your 
background and like what were your early 
experiences with cooking?
Vanessa Lingenfelter's Grandmother: When I was younger, I 
was around my mom all the time.
Unknown speaker: Where were you born?
Vanessa Lingenfelter's Grandmother: Yeah, I was born in 
Naples.
Unknown speaker: Italy. 
Vanessa Lingenfelter's Grandmother: Mhm. And I was around 
my mom all the time when she was do the cooking 
for seven children.
Vanessa Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Vanessa Lingenfelter's Grandmother: Yeah. My mother had 
seven children, so she had to do a lot of 
cooking.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, something that I've talked about a lot 
in my class is how so much of cooking and food is 
passed down through family and not through like 
official, like culinary school or through just 
like a cookbook published by a company. So, like, 
what kinds of things were you and your family 
like cooking around this time?
Grandmother: OK, my mom. Because we were seven children 
plus themselves. We were nine people. In the 
house, so she had to be pretty -- pretty savvy, 
you know, to cook. So, they bought a lot of -- 
they have a lot of dishes in Naples, but they are 
pretty cheap.
Lingenfelter: [laughs] Yeah.
Grandmother: Like we -- a lot of times we just stayed -- We 
had a different way to time wise, you know to eat 
over there. So, in the morning, like breakfast 
was we call it zuppa di latte, like all the bread 
soaked in the milk for breakfast.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: And then a lot of times my dad, he will buy 
berries. The farmers, they came from suburb, it 
came in a city to sell berries.
Lingenfelter: Mhm.
Grandmother: So, we added this habit, we got these habits 
in Naples. The people you know, they don't want 
to go downstairs, you know, all the time to buy 
something. So, they had this little basket with 
the rope. We put the, you know, the basket down 
and the berry vendor, he will put -- in a dish 
that we put in a basket, he will put a bunch of 
berries in there. So, we did that too at times, 
you know, like a couple of times a week in the 
summer.
Lingenfelter: Mm-hm. And then Naples is a really 
interesting place because of how old it is as a 
city. It's older than Rome. And so there are 
certain ways of preparing food and foods 
themselves that go back like hundreds of years, 
thousands of years even. And that kind of reminds 
me a little bit of what we were talking about 
yesterday about the kind of Italian 
traditionalism when it comes to food, and I'm 
curious, would you consider yourself very 
traditional about food?
Grandmother: Yes -- yes, I think myself traditional because 
that's where I come from you know. So, I brought 
the tradition over here, but when I came over 
here, the food was different to me. And in Naples 
--
Unknown speaker: Sweet? 
Grandmother: Yeah, it was all like -- to me, it tastes 
sweet. Everything is sweet. And the people here, 
they put everything they want in one plate. You 
know, we are used over there to, to eat in the 
first course, the second course and once in a 
while, maybe like a dessert once a week or some 
dessert. Like we ate the Sunday sauce. You know 
the -- we had beef once a week. You know most 
how, food, it was more base and legumes, 
vegetable. And then fish, you know, we got a lot 
of fish over there because we are on the ocean.
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: So, once a week, we had the meat that we call 
it like ragù.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: The? What? What do they call over here? The 
meat sauce for Sunday? Yeah. And that's, you 
know, and the lot of influence of the food in 
Italy in Naples, it came from -- because Naples 
was under a lot of -- 
Unknown speaker: Rulers. 
Grandmother: A lot of rulers, you know, like they were on 
the king. You know the kings to rule the city. 
And they had other government like Spanish, 
Greek. It was ruled by Greek -- by Romans, by 
Greek, by Spaniard, you know, and --
Unknown speaker: French. 
Grandmother: French, you know, so they lived on a lot of 
different rules, so they kind of picked a lot of 
different way of leading.
Lingenfelter: Right. 
Grandmother: And they put them together, you know.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, a lot of different influences.
Grandmother: Lot of -- Yeah, a lot of different influences, 
yeah.
Lingenfelter: And so, I thought it was interesting, you 
were talking about how the structure of how meals 
work in the US is very different from Italy. In 
Italy, you have the different courses. Is there 
like a kind of -- what is like the purpose behind 
having the kind of different courses instead of 
it all on one plate. I've heard different things, 
but I'm curious about your opinion.
Grandmother: Well, like in the -- like in the morning we 
had a, you know breakfast which it was like, you 
know, all the bread. You know if there was some 
bread left. You know? 
Lingenfelter: Uh-huh. 
Grandmother: And put milk in there. Actually, Papa, you 
know now, once in a while he does that and he's 
not Italian. You know he loves the, you know, the 
bread with the milk. So, but over there like, so 
in the morning we ate that. And then usually like 
we call it pranzo, which it's the one that you 
call over here lunch.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: Like we did the main dishes, you know, at 
1:00. Maybe 12:30, 1 to 1:30, you know that kind 
of? Yeah. Most it's made by legumes. 
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: They should -- You know, they're pretty cheap, 
you know. So, with the legume dishes, with the 
pasta. You know, my mother, she was able, you 
know, to feed all of us, you know. 
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: So that's what most we had, you know, like, at 
least in my family, you know, like maybe some 
other people they had some salad with that, you 
know, things like that, you know. But most of the 
time we had the legumes dishes or just maybe 
pasta with the vegetable, you know. Again, in one 
dish, you know and then maybe in the evening we 
call it's what you call over here dinner, you 
know, for us it was Cena, it means dinner. I 
guess you know. And then over there we had. Well 
-- we were not a well to do family, in other 
words. You know, so we didn't have a -- like a 
need to -- every day you know things like that. 
At times we had maybe another dish of legumes and 
vegetable, you know, or maybe some eggs, you 
know, eggs. We use a lot of times, eggs. At times 
like a mozzarella, Buffalo mozzarella, you know, 
those are they would all -- like cheap kind of 
way of eating, you know, like the one you call a 
Caprese over there, well we had them a couple of 
times a week over there, you know caprese with 
tomatoes and mozzarella. Yeah. So, bread. You 
know, bread. There was a big staple in a house. 
You know, actually, my father, he used to -- his 
job was to prepare a document for people that 
they need but they don't want to go themselves, 
you know, to different offices. You know people, 
they used to pay him with the food. So, they used 
to give him a nice big, you know, big we call A 
big crusty bread, you know, and a thing full of 
eggs too. Fresh eggs from a chicken, you know. 
So, we, you know, we used to wait for my father 
to bring those things, you know. And we were all 
happy when they call you know? And he had this 
big fresh bread, you know. With a lot of eggs you 
know, and some figs. Fresh figs, you know? Yeah, 
all of that stuff, you know. So, but that's -- 
And then we ate the fish, you know, that's always 
la Cena. I know. In the evening, you know. 
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: Right and fish, we ate a lot of dishes with 
fish, which over there some fish was, you know, 
always on the cheap side. You know, like those 
little smelt, you know. We had octopus. There are 
things that you know, we ate liver, you know veal 
liver. That was a cheaper cut of, you know, from 
animal, you know, from a veal or beef, you know, 
things like that. And then once a week, we ate on 
Sunday, you know, we ate the, like I say the 
ragù, you know.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. Something that's really fascinating 
about that is how -- because I think that a lot 
of people, at least in the US, tend to associate 
Italian food as being like, very like, high class 
or very like kind of expensive or like wealthy, 
but a lot of the most famous Italian foods, 
especially like Neapolitan foods come from like 
working class families who were able to make 
things that were very delicious out of the 
resources that they had. 
Grandmother: Right. 
Lingenfelter: I was watching -- or there's this series -- 
that it's on, it's on CNN, but I think it's also 
on prime. But it's this guy who goes around to 
different regions in Italy and he has like -- so 
it's all about the food in that region. 
Grandmother: Right, yeah. 
Lingenfelter: And I watched yesterday the Naples episode, 
and he was talking about how pizza was originally 
created by like the poor in Naples because it was 
a effective way to feed a lot of people at once 
and it wasn't super expensive to make. 
Grandmother: Right, that's true. But there is a story 
behind the pizza, how it came about, you know? 
But why did they call a pizza Margarita?
Lingenfelter: Because of the Queen of Italy?
Grandmother: Yeah, the queen was hungry, you know. Right. 
And she say -- I like something fun to eat, you 
know. And one of these, a person that was working 
for her, you know. His name is Gennarino Gennaro. 
Genaro went and they cooked up some flour and 
water and yeast, you know? And he came up with 
this pizza and he called Margarita.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: Even if the pizza was made before by other 
people, you know, but the Margarita, you know, it 
came up because the queen, you know. And he made 
them as the color of the Italian flag.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. Yeah. 
Grandmother: Green -- White, the mozzarella, red, the 
tomatoes and green the basil. 
Lingenfelter: Mhm. Yeah and you know, it's so simple, but 
it's so good. But I feel like that's so much of 
Italian cuisine is that the ingredients 
themselves are very simple, but they're so high 
quality and where so much --
Grandmother: Right, everything is fresh, you know, like 
usually people -- and I think they still do it 
nowadays, you know, maybe they change a little 
bit, but people there, they go everyday grocery 
they go on the market, the Fresh Market you know 
and they buy just enough for the day. So, the 
life of a woman over there, a mom, you know or a 
woman in general. You know, it's pretty busy.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: Because you gotta think they gotta kids-- kids 
usually they don't gotta bus to go to school over 
there they walk to go to school. You know. 
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: And they went, I don't know, nowadays, you 
know for sure. But when I was young, we used to 
wear a uniform to school, which it was just, how 
do you -- [Unclear]. Someday you put on top the 
clothes on the bottom, you know. So, everyone 
looks equal.  And to differentiate the grade that 
you were in, they had like different colors like 
you know some kids they wore black with the white 
collar and the big ribbon here in the front. You 
know, and the ribbon, the ribbon will tell me 
what grade they were in. You know, things like 
that. And then white. So, girls, they wore white 
and boys they wore black.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: On the bottom they had the -- they had the 
clothes, you know, like maybe shorts, you know, 
things like that.
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: You know so, but like the food, the part, you 
know, it's pretty like you said, it's pretty 
cheap in a way. I can make some dishes over here 
that I just use maybe no more than four 
ingredients.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: A few of them even, it's got less, you know, 
ingredients like the Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, you 
know, garlic and oil, you know that just got the 
three ingredients, garlic, oil, and spaghetti. 
That's it. So, you can make pretty cheap dishes, 
you know, and they are good for you too. I mean, 
they are good. They are not fatty dishes; you 
know like if you go in Italy even now you know 
about 80% of the people you know they are a 
pretty normal weight.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: So, they walk a lot, you know? Yeah, they walk 
because most of the people they live in the city, 
you know, most of the people and they got a 
suburb too, but the suburb, they look like more 
mini city, you know being able to walk wherever 
they go, you know they do got a car and 
everything but a lot of times they walk. 
Lingenfelter: Yeah, that's like a -- I feel like a European 
thing in general, because I noticed the same 
thing when I was visiting my dad in Germany. And 
I was so jealous because I hate driving, it 
scares me.
Grandmother: Right, right. Yeah. I didn't have a driver 
license when I was in Italy and I was, I was 
there up to 24 years old cause I came in United 
States when I was 24.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. So, it's not like Denton, which is 
where I live, like during the school year. It's 
like you have to drive everywhere, even like five 
minutes, ten minutes to go to the grocery store 
like you have to drive. I mean, you could walk, 
but it's like dangerous.
Grandmother: Right, right, right.
Lingenfelter: And it's kind of scary. 
Grandmother: Well, now especially nowadays, you know, 
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: Over here like it's too far to go grocery 
without, you know, without a car, you know. 
Because over here, we do the grocery once a week 
at least, you know. So, we got four or five bags, 
5 to 6 bags. You know, like in Italy they go day 
by day. They buy everything in cash, you know.
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Lingenfelter: Because one of the things, I feel like this 
is like a very American thing, but like the sort 
of big like Costco or Sam's Club type stores 
where you buy everything in bulk. 
Grandmother: Right, yeah. 
Lingenfelter: It's like, supposed to last you two weeks. I 
feel like that's something that only makes sense 
in the United States.
Grandmother: Right.
Lingenfelter: It's like, you know, you're not going to the 
grocery store every day because who wants to, 
like, get in their car and drive every day but in 
Italy and a lot of European cities like that's 
just not a problem.
Grandmother: Yeah. So, I had to learn all of those things 
over here, different culture. You know it's I 
mean our culture is the same, you know Europe and 
the United States, the culture is generally the 
same. You know, but lately they really over the 
years they start to change. You know like Italy 
is still Europe, I mean not just Italy, it's 
still a traditional kind of way you know. So, 
when I came over here and it was pretty 
different. The weight was different, the food was 
different. You know, the way of living, you know, 
like I had to learn to go to grocery once a week. 
You know, I didn't drove, so Papa, he drove me to 
the store. You know, I do the grocery and I 
didn't know the language either, you know. So, he 
kind of was helping me to buy stuff, you know. 
But eventually, you know, I learn the language 
all by myself, you know, through a TV, to talk 
with people you know. So that's how I learned the 
language over here. 
Lingenfelter: Yeah. Kind of back to what we're talking 
about the ingredients in Italy, the ingredients 
here are different, like it's a different 
climate. It's just not the same. And so, was that 
something that you noticed or something that you 
struggled with, or had to adapt to? Trying to 
reproduce Italian dishes, but with American 
ingredients?
Grandmother: In the beginning, you know I start to forget -
- not forget about, you know, I start to learn 
the American way. You know to cook. You know, 
like I learned some dishes from Papa's parents. 
You know, when we came over here and I start to 
do those because I wanted to please. You know to 
show whatever the food that he was familiar with. 
And so, what I did, you know, I changed, you 
know, a little bit and but I realized after quite 
a few years, you know, after I had a couple of 
kids, you know, I realized that I was putting 
weight on. 
Lingenfelter: [laughs]
Grandmother: So, I tried to go back to the tradition, the 
way the Italian traditional way because, believe 
it or not, the Italian food, that's not fatty. 
It's different than the one they cook over here 
in the restaurant.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: So once I made a --
Unknown speaker: Eat smaller portions. 
Grandmother: And we do eat the smaller portions. You know 
in Italy, you know, if you go in Italy even a 
restaurant they put you little bit food that's 
why you are able to eat the first course and the 
second course you know, and even the third 
course, you know so. Because they put a small 
amount in the plate.
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: Here you put -- You know you go in the 
restaurant, you know, they got the appetizer, 
they gotta you know, those big dish of pasta, you 
know? So, but when I start to change my way of 
eating, you know, and I start to introduce some 
more legumes, you know, pasta dish too, but not a 
big portion. Simple dishes. You know, I just have 
to lose weight.
Lingenfelter: Mhm.
Grandmother: You know, that's the difference. You know, in 
a way about the culture, you know, like we use 
olive oil, you know, extra virgin olive oil all 
the time. We are the -- well over there in the 
South in Italy, they use olive oil in the north, 
they use more butter. 
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: Because in Italy we got the olive trees, you 
know, and all the weather's good, you know, in 
the North they, you know, they got they got more, 
they eat more meat. In other words, they eat more 
meat because they don't got the ocean over there, 
you know.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: So, because they want to buy everything fresh 
a lot of times, they don't eat the fish. But we 
in the south, we eat a lot of fish, a lot of 
tomatoes, you know, I mean, all that stuff, a lot 
of vegetable.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, climate has, like, a really big, 
[unclear] on what people eat. 
Grandmother: Yeah.
Lingenfelter: I'm curious what, like American dishes were 
you kind of cooking, like when you first moved 
here.
Grandmother: I start to make a macaroni cheese goulash. 
Pork chops. Stew. I guess you know, I don't know 
how you call that Stew.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: Lot of fried fish, you know? But we bought 
them frozen. You know.
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: In the supermarket, but, Yeah, all that stuff 
everything, fried you know. And I used butter, 
you know. A lot of that stuff. I forgot about my 
soups. You know, I make a lot of soups now. You 
know, we make a lot of soups we make [laughs]. 
But yeah, it was. It was different. You know, 
everything tasted sweet, you know, over here 
every day they use, they have a dessert. Some 
kind of dessert. That's what I know. This, you 
know, like my Papa's parents. You know, they 
almost every day they had some kind of dessert, 
you know? No -- you know, we hardly had the fresh 
fruit.
Unknown speaker: In Italy they had fruit for dessert. 
Grandmother: In Italy dessert is fruit.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: We eat, we do eat ice cream. You know that 
Gelato, we call it over there, you know. But it's 
just once a week, though, you know, that kind of 
stuff. It's not a usual day, after the meal we 
eat dessert. Yeah. 
Lingenfelter: Yeah, no, it's different. Were there any ways 
that it was different but in a good way? Or in a 
way that you wanted to kind of incorporate into 
your life? 
Grandmother: In the United States? 
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: [laughing] Yeah, it's hard --
Lingenfelter: Think hard.
Unknown speaker: Shopping once a week. 
Grandmother: Yeah, well, the shopping once a week. It was 
convenient, you know, especially when you got a 
smaller child, you know. I had my first son, you 
know, right when I had to change everything, you 
know. So once a week it was convenient to go 
grocery. And yeah, you know, I mean it --
Unknown speaker: One store instead of the small stores. 
Grandmother: Yeah, one big store instead of a small store. 
Like over there. They got a small store, you 
know. They do got a supermarket over there, but 
most people go in a small store to do the 
shopping. They got the bread store, the fish 
stall. You know, actually the face, it's an open 
store, you know, it's an opener area, that they 
sell fish. Like the meat store, they got 
everything separate, you know. So maybe that that 
part is fun to do, when you are used to do it, 
you know, because everything is fresh. But go 
grocery once a week, it was more convenient over 
here, so. The weather too, was different when I 
came over here. You know? 
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: When I first came over here, there was a lot 
of snow. I never saw snow in my life!
Lingenfelter: Yeah, [unclear]. 
Grandmother: Yeah. The only snow we saw over there was 
usually like on top of the Vesuvio. The volcano 
that we got over there.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: The Vesuvio Volcano. We saw a little bit, you 
know, on top of the mountain there you know, but 
there's no snow over there, at least in the 
South.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: In the north they, you know, they do get some 
snow there, you know.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. So, in the US like particularly in like 
the northeastern US, there's a lot of people who 
have like Italian ancestry, like their 
grandparents or like great grandparents, all 
immigrated from Italy. And so the US like 
received like some of the largest amounts of 
Italian immigrants in the world during like the 
early 20th century. So as a result of that, 
there's kind of like a sort of Italian American 
cuisine. I think it's like very much Italian 
influence, but it's also very much distinctly 
American.
Grandmother: Right. They change. Did you ever hear the 
Alfredo sauce today? That doesn't exist in Italy.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. I've heard that before.
Grandmother: I don't know. You know what? You know, I call 
them a heart attack dish. Alfredo sauce 
[laughing]. But yeah, when the immigrants they 
came over here from Italy you know they brought 
the culture over here and then you know you gotta 
adjust yourself you know like I adjusted myself 
you know, over the years, because I feel like I 
live over here, you know, and I gotta adjust to 
this culture, you know? So, it was not that hard 
to do it, you know. It's just like when you come 
from another country and then, you know, I came 
over here because, you know, we got married, you 
know, I met Papa when he was in service over 
there in the military. So, we got married over 
there, you know, and we came over here. So, but 
everything else, I mean, you know, the food -- 
the food is food, you know. I just gotta -- you 
know, the bad things. I got, the habits. I didn't 
realize then, you know. But when I start to see 
my weight coming up. You know, I say I better go 
back and eat my beans. My Mediterranean diet you 
know, in a way, you -- I think that you heard 
about Mediterranean diet, right?
Lingenfelter: Yes.
Grandmother: Yeah, well, that's what it is. That's what I 
follow. That's the traditional way to eat in in 
Italy.
Lingenfelter: Mhm.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. So, you've kind of like, had this 
experience of, you know, you grow up in Italy 
with Neapolitan Italian food and then you move to 
the US and you kind of adjust and adapt to sort 
of US cuisine, but then now you've kind of sort 
of found like a middle ground between the two?
Grandmother: Yeah, yeah. I think mostly I do cook 
Neapolitan because they are pretty easy dishes to 
make. And actually, now I gotta, you know Dylan? 
Yeah. He asked me if I can teach him how to cook. 
So, he comes every Saturday and we cook something 
together. You know, some of my Italian real 
Italian dish.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, and you know, I mean, that's like the 
best way to learn how to cook is from family 
because there's certain things -- there's some 
knowledge that you kind of have to know by 
watching and not just from a recipe. Like my mom 
taught me how to make Brigadeiro, which is like a 
Brazilian dessert.
Grandmother: Right.
Lingenfelter: And I was trying to -- because I made it for 
some people in one of my classes last semester, 
and my friend Liam, he was like, "Oh, can you 
send me a recipe?"  And I was like, I don't have 
a recipe, but I wrote something down. I just, 
like, wrote down, like, some stuff. But like when 
he made it by himself, like it didn't end up good 
because there are certain things like that you 
kind of just have to watch to know. And it's 
like, OK, just like, come over, I'll show you how 
to make it.
Grandmother: Right. Well, you're right. Because I feel the 
same way. You know, when somebody, even in my own 
kids, you know, when somebody asked me said "Oh, 
can you give me the recipe," you know?
Grandmother: I say no, my recipe, you know, I write stuff 
down, you know. But when I see something by my 
memory, you know and everything. But I write in 
both languages, you know. So, I write half in 
Italian and half in English so nobody can be able 
to -- And then, you know, I really do a -- you 
know, it's not like a recipe book, you know. I 
write it down by the book, in other words. You 
know, I write just the way I make the thing, you 
know, like one spoon of this one spoon of that, 
you know, I don't measure a lot of stuff. You 
know, I just put everything in there, you know 
and the dish comes out good. 
Lingenfelter: Yeah, sometimes you gotta -- I feel like 
baking is one of those things where, like you do 
need to have like kind of very exact 
measurements, but with cooking you kind of just 
need vibes. 
Grandmother: Right, right. Yeah. Bakery in any -- in any, 
even the United States, a Baker, you know, you 
gotta have the exact measurement, you know, 
otherwise it won't come out. You know, one cup of 
this, one cup of that. Like I -- that's the 
measurement that too were different over here 
when I came you know because we use grams you 
know kilogram, grams you know over here you use a 
pound or ounces, you know, things like that. We 
weigh everything there. If I need like let's say 
one kilogram of flour, you know, right over here 
it's --
Unknown speaker: 2.2 pounds. 
Grandmother: .2 pounds. 
Unknown speaker: 2.2.
Grandmother: 2.2 pounds. You know we gotta deal with 
pounds. Or maybe cups, one cup of this, one cup 
of that. You know, over there they weigh 
everything, or like a lot of times they say una 
taza. Well, how much is one? One Cup over here is 
not the same as over there. Taza. Taza means a 
cup. Really, you know? But it's not the same 
measurement. You know, so that's another thing I 
had learned. Like when you go to the grocery, 
when I used to go to the grocery store. When I 
first came, you know, I was used to say, 
[unclear] right. Well, I had learned to say how 
much is a [unclear] gram or two oz. You know, the 
two or three oz is the same now. So, I start to 
say I like six slice of mortadella. Decided to 
say you know the -- because I didn't know, so I 
even in nowadays, you know, if I gotta get 
something, I don't say half a pound or one pound, 
you know, I say well, give me a four slice of 
prosciutto. You know, so. That's the way I 
managed to in the beginning -- I managed to 
survive. In other words, here.
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: You know.
Grandmother: Even nowadays, people when I talk, you know, I 
got an accent, you know, so a lot of people, they 
go. "Huh. Huh." And every time they say," huh, 
huh?," you know, right. I keep making a mistake. 
You know, I do try to say in a way that they 
would understand. You know, but it's normal, you 
know, I mean that kind of stuff so.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, it's like. It's like nerve wracking 
when people are like noticing that you're making 
mistake and then that nervousness makes it worse. 
Grandmother: Yeah, right. Right. You get nervous because 
you make a mistake and you realize that people 
don't understand you, you know? But I think some 
people, too. They don't pay attention when you 
talk. You know, they don't gotta patience with 
people that they got an accent.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, that's true. 
Grandmother: Yeah, that's what I find out over the years, 
you know. And after a while, you really, you 
know, it's annoying, you know, for us that we 
learn the entire -- I learned the entire language 
over here you know from I didn't go to school to 
learn. You know, I learned myself, you know by 
talk with people and by watch TV news program. 
You know, things like that. Read the magazine. 
You know, that's what I learned, you know. But.
Lingenfelter: And I wonder if that kind of changes 
depending on where you are, like if you're in a 
city where -- like New York City or something 
like that, where there's a lot more immigrants 
and so people are generally having more 
experience talking to people with accents or 
maybe there might be more patients just because 
of the experience. But I don't know. 
Grandmother: Probably, you know, probably they're more -- 
Yeah, they are, you know, quite a few Italian 
over here because I, I mean, I don't gotta too 
many friends, you know. But from the food I see 
in the in the grocery store, you know, they got a 
lot of Italian. They got the-- where I go they 
got a lot of good Italian product, you know, from 
Italy, that's what I'm looking for. A lot of 
times when I do my grocery, you know, I look for 
Italian product.
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: You know, so, but I'm lucky that where I live, 
they got a nice grocery store that they get all 
this stuff. At least most of it you know. So.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. No, that's like whenever like when I 
first went to Denton, like, the first thing that 
I like -- one of the first things I did was like 
Google, like Italian grocery store near me, 
Brazilian grocery store near me like.
Grandmother: Oh, yeah. 
Lingenfelter: You know there's certain things that like you 
can't just find out, like I don't know Kroger or 
what? What they have up there anymore, like 
Wegmans.
Grandmother: Yeah, they got a lot of Italian. They got it 
because you, I mean, your dad is, you know, he's 
American but he's, you know, I'm his mom. So, you 
know, he's like he's got a Italian ancestor let's 
say, and then your mom is from Brazil, so you got 
a Brazilian ancestor, you know? Yeah, you're 
kinda between the two country, you know. But it's 
interesting to learn to make Brazilian dishes 
too. You know the original one, you know?
Lingenfelter: Yeah.
Grandmother: That your mom, you know your momma brought. 
You know so.
Lingenfelter: It's very interesting because Brazil's 
actually a lot like the United States in the 
sense that the food is influenced by having like 
lots of immigrants.
Grandmother: Yeah.
Lingenfelter: And so like it's really like -- because like 
I was saying before, there's a lot of like a lot 
of Italian immigrants that left Italy in like the 
20th century, especially in the South, but 
they're in the United States, is one of the big 
places that they went, but also a lot of Italians 
went to South America mainly and Brazil.
Grandmother: Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. And believe it or 
not, you know when because a lot of Italians, 
they came, especially the South, not much the 
north, but the South people from the South where 
we are, the more immigrants over here after the 
war was over, but when they came over here, you 
know, they were not welcome. You know, they 
didn't wanna -- They used to say no Italians, you 
know. They used to call people names. You know. 
They thought they had some kind of name for the 
Italians, I don't remember now what else? What? 
OK, what? 
Unknown speaker: Wops.
Grandmother: Wops. It means -- well they thought everybody 
belongs to a mafia or something, you know? But 
they gotta you know, I mean they are mafia 
everywhere. You know this Italian mafia there's 
Chinese mafia, Russian mafia they are like you 
know South American. But yeah, always there are 
those groups like that, you know? So. But the 
Italians, though they brought a lot of trade. 
Like who was like was make shoes. Who was a chef? 
You know, they cook them at the pizza. They had 
the constructions, you know, they did the -- they 
brought a lot of trades. You know, they were not 
on the government, you know, ends out. In other 
words, they made, they made something out of 
themself.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. And it's interesting because something 
that in this class I'm doing this project for, we 
talked a lot about Italians in Argentina and 
there was kind of like a different experience 
there because a lot of the Italian immigrants 
that went to Argentina were skewed more wealthy, 
like a lot, is a lot of them were from the north 
and a lot of them from like kind of more upper 
class families, right? So, we kind of talked 
about how in the US Italians like experienced a 
lot of discrimination. There was like a very much 
like a negative experience there, whereas in 
Argentina there was kind of -- it wasn't really 
the same because a lot of Argentinians wanted 
more Italians. They wanted more European 
immigrants because they felt like Europe was like 
more classy and so they were kind of put on a 
pedestal, almost. And so, it's interesting how 
perceived like wealth or perceived class -- 
Grandmother: Well, they were more like they had more trade. 
You know they, so they could help the, let's say 
people in another country to learn a trade.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: That kind of stuff because yeah, you can. And 
we, you know, the in the South we were poor, but 
we still had the trades, though, you know, we 
still had the trades today. Now I came over here 
because, you know, I got married, you know, with 
an American dad and believe it or not, when I got 
married, you know, Papa had to prove -- and he's 
an American, you know, an American citizen. No, 
he had to prove to the American Embassy in 
Naples, you know, that he had a job over here.
Lingenfelter: Mhm.
Grandmother: So, his father had a hardware store, right? 
So, they made the notarized document, let's say 
no, that he would have a job with them when he 
came back.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: You know in United States?
Unknown speaker: So, you could come. 
Grandmother: So, I can come. Otherwise, even if I was 
married, I wouldn't been able to come. If he 
didn't prove that he had the job over here.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, I think a lot of people don't realize 
how complex the application process can be.
Grandmother: They did all of the tests, you know, all the -
- and finally the shots I need. You know they 
give me a shots you know before I came over here 
I mean all of the, you know everything you know 
like. Yeah. So. But I changed my life in about 3 
months.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: I was 24, so now it's about well, 53 years 
that I that I'm in this country, you know.
Lingenfelter: 
Yeah. And so, we were talking about how, you know, in the 
beginning, like you kind of adjusted to sort of 
like a more American way of life, particularly 
with cooking. And then you kind of adjusted back 
to like a more Mediterranean diet.
Grandmother: Right, right. 
Lingenfelter: At what at what point like in the timeline 
here, did you kind of go back more to sort of 
your roots?
Grandmother: Yeah, after many years because you know, for 
about for about 20 years, you know, probably 
after about 20 to 25 years or so, you know, for 
about 20 years I was homesick. You know, home in 
my country, in other words, you know, family, you 
know, country, you know, kind of thing. I was 
home sick. So, I was upset a lot of times. You 
know, I was sad, you know. So, but I, you know, 
after a while because I had my children now. You 
know, they kept me occupied. You know, because I 
was home. I never work outside the home, you 
know. So, I was one of those people you call 
housewife. Yeah, so, you know, but. No, I you 
know. And then I have to walk a little bit to the 
time, you know I got used to it. You know the 
first time that we -- that I went back in Italy 
for a visit you know it was after 27 years.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: Came over here. Yeah, so. 
Lingenfelter: And was it, was it sort of kind of after 
like, you know, like your kids had all sort of, 
like grown up and kind of left and done their own 
thing. Like, did that have an impact at all on, 
like how your homesickness or how you looked at 
kind of your relationship to your Italian-ness.
Grandmother: No, I mean the actually. 
Unknown speaker: The internet helped a lot. 
Grandmother: Yeah. The Internet and Facebook kind of kind 
of helped a lot, you know, to communicate in 
Italian with my, you know. So, I didn't forget it 
because after a while, you know if you don't 
speak the language you know you forget about it 
you know and it's sad that when you are, you 
know, speak, you start to speak another language, 
you gradually you know, you forget your own 
language, you know. But with the TV, which I got 
a cable program, you know from Italy, so I watch 
that you know, and I understand everything. Now I 
can speak better in Italian too, you know, like 
and stuff. But I just wish that I taught my 
children Italian. But I didn't because I was 
afraid that they would not be able to learn 
English. So, I didn't want them to be 
embarrassed. You know that people, kids, they 
wouldn't understand them. So, I kind of forgot 
about my language you know, and I start to talk 
English.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: All the time, you know, gradually when I learn 
the language, you know, so.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. 
Grandmother: But now they don't know. You know, they don't 
know how to speak Italian, so you know.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. Would it be fair to say that your sort 
of return to cooking more Neapolitan dishes is 
kind of part of a larger like a larger experience 
of you trying to, like reconnect with your 
culture?
Grandmother: Yes, yes. Yeah. Yes. Because 
Unknown speaker: And it's healthier. 
Grandmother: And it's healthy too. I mean, that's probably 
a good reason, you know, like we hardly go over 
McDonald's. You know, we hardly go over Burger 
King, you know, and even a restaurant now, you 
know, we hardly go. I found the difficulty to eat 
American food in restaurant -- oh Italian food in 
a restaurant because it's not the same. You know, 
so I'm more aware of what I what I eat. So, I, 
you know, I tell everybody the Mediterranean 
diet. It's a good diet just to cut the portion, 
you know, smaller.
Unknown speaker: It's a way of living, not a diet. 
Grandmother: Yeah, it's a way of living. It's not a diet.
Lingenfelter: Mhm. 
Grandmother: You know we say dieta de mediterraneo, but 
it's not really dieta. It's just a normal way of 
eating. You know, unless you got a health 
problem, like if you got diabetes maybe, you 
know, or if you're gluten intolerant, you can't 
eat starch, you know, things like that. But if 
you are healthy, you know, and Mediterranean 
diet, a smaller portion and you gotta move. 
That's what you gotta do too. Move like, you 
know, go for a walk. Yeah, you know, I'm. I'm 
used to now being over here. I've been, like I 
said, I've been 53 years here, you know, so and 
you know my kids they are older. You know, I'm 
very proud of my kids, your dad you know and Raj 
and Daniella, you know they are they are pretty 
well established, you know, so.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, and kind of a little bit going back to 
what you said before about diets as kind of being 
not just a diet but a way of life. I want to go 
in on that a little bit more because I feel like 
that's so true because the way that you engage 
with food, it's a lifestyle. And like you, you 
can structure so much of your life around that 
like you were saying before about how the times 
that you eat are maybe like are the amount that 
you eat are different and --
Grandmother: That's one thing we always did, you know, like 
when my kids were young. You know, we always make 
sure we all eat together. Dinner. Yeah. So that 
was good, you know.
Lingenfelter: Yeah. And I think that's really important 
because like mealtimes like, I mean obviously 
there's like there's like health and there's 
sustenance, but it's also like a way to come 
together and to kind of --
Grandmother: Communicate, communicate with the family and 
everything.
Lingenfelter: Yeah, it's a form of communion and like and 
that's also like having that kind of habit 
because I also grew up like always eating 
together with my family at the dinner table. And 
no, like, phones or like distractions at the 
dinner table. And now like -- which, like my 
parents, probably learned from their parents like 
my dad, probably learned from you. And now, like 
when I'm like, eating because, like, I have 
dinner like me and my roommates, we take turns 
like making dinner and we all eat together. And 
like, we don't go on our phones out during 
dinner. And so, it's kind of like reproducing 
that same tradition.
Grandmother: Right. Well, even like even when you're in 
college, you know, you gotta get a roommate that 
you guys got about the same, you know, the same 
habits you know can --
Unknown speaker: Compatible. 
Grandmother: Compatible, in other words, you know, just 
like a marriage. You know, if you get married, 
you know you gotta be compatible with the other 
person, you know, in otherwise they wouldn't 
work. We should, we talked about how many -- an 
hour? 
Lingenfelter: I think almost two hours.
Grandmother: Oh my God! But that was good, you know we had 
a good talk.
