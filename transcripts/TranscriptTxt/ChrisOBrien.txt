Mark O'Brien: All right. Hi, this is Mark O'Brien for a 
Spanish 4173, Dr. Mendiola's class and this is my 
oral interview with Chris O'Brien, my wife, and 
we're doing this interview in Richardson, Texas. 
So Chris, just given your name, but could you 
tell us exactly where you were born and how long 
you've lived here? 
Chris O'Brien: Actually, I was born in the Dallas area, and 
I've lived here my entire life. I've never lived 
anywhere but Dallas. I actually was born in the 
Pleasant Grove area of Dallas, and we stayed 
there until just about high school time before my 
parents moved to Rockwall, but still in the 
Dallas area.
Mark O'Brien: So, you've been, when it comes to living in 
Dallas in foods and things like that you've been 
in Texas. So, you've been exposed to this kind 
of, these kinds of different products since 
you've been a little girl actually.
Chris O'Brien: That's right. Southern food, Mexican food, 
some other different ethnicities food, but mostly 
southern food.
Mark O'Brien: Okay. So, since we've met in, I'd say, for 
maybe 15 years, maybe it's a little less you 
switched to a plant-based diet. Can you tell me 
what actually started that process for you to go 
from just eating meat, potatoes or whatever was 
available to strictly plant-based?
Chris O'Brien: Although it was definitely a journey, I 
would say the thing that triggered the plant 
base, the specifics of it was the China study and 
that was introduced to me by a colleague at work. 
He had read it and he brought it to me and 
thought I would be interested in it. So, I've 
read it. And that proposed a strictly plant-based 
diet. In other words, no animal products 
whatsoever. So, though I had been exposed to 
other diets that limited animal products, a 
vegetarian, and that sort of thing, but still 
allows some other aspects like butter, or maybe 
dairy or eggs. This was the first time I've been 
experienced, exposed to something that was 
proposing, the healthiest way to eat was to have 
no animal products. So that was the trigger for 
me. 
Mark O'Brien: And what, just so people that are listening 
know, what was the China, the China Study driven 
for was to study the long-term effects of plant-
based eating or the health effects of plant-based 
eating was that what the basis of that study was 
for?
Chris O'Brien: That's what I took away from it. Yes. And 
granted, you know, this was probably 12 to 15 
years ago, that we're talking about. So, it was a 
long time ago, but I was very much, it impacted 
me very much in the sense that in order to do it 
correctly, and to reap the benefits, you needed 
to have absolutely no animal products in your 
diet.
Mark O'Brien: Have you found this to be, living in Texas 
with the kind of food that's popular here, like 
Southern Tex-Mex, and even an authentic Mexican 
and other foods that use a lot of meat and 
cheese. Have you found this hard to have this 
diet and continue it? Not only well, let's start 
with on restaurants. Is it very hard to find a 
restaurant that does this? 
Chris O'Brien: Absolutely, I mean, it's almost impossible. 
I always joke around with folks that, "Hey, you 
know, if you want to eat like this, you can't 
drive up somewhere and have it shoved in the car 
window door." It's not, it's not available like 
that, there's just no way to do it and go into a 
restaurant and trying to order something that's 
plant based is very difficult. I mean, obviously, 
you can fall back to the John, was a salad, you 
know, and frequently restaurants put cheese in 
their salads. So, you have to check to be sure it 
doesn't have cheese in it. And, but folks, that 
you know, people that work in restaurants are 
starting to become a little more sensitive to it. 
But when we talk about 15 years ago, or 12 or 15 
years ago, when I started this, it was even 
harder than it was very, very boring thing to 
people that to even comprehend that someone would 
eat that way.
Mark O'Brien: Well, and the reason I bring this up, is I've 
noticed in the last couple of months when I've 
been working at Stars games, I come out of the 
building. And it's similar to what we saw out of 
the -- What is it, the church, the one that's 
there on? Gosh, I want to say Ross or maybe Ross, 
the Catholic Church there that -- the place 
escapes me, but I come off and there's someone in 
there is street food, there is street food 
vendors that are cooking Cerdito and tacos, 
street tacos and things like that. And they 
always have meat in it, of course. So I just 
wondered as I walked by, and I think of you I 
think how street vendor... wonder what... how that 
would work for street vendors, if they were 
strictly providing a vegan or plant based diet, 
you know, I don't know if that if people would 
realize they were eating that and like it or 
people would look at it and see no meat, you 
know, so that's why I question it. As to is this 
what kind of drove -- So you do most of your 
preparing of food at home I'm guessing, that's 
what. I see you here, and I'm thinking before 
that you were. That's what you do?
Chris O'Brien: I do I've and I've gravitated towards that 
this is not there's not a switch that you flip 
and then all of a sudden, you're doing things a 
different way. It's been something that has 
progressed over time, and I've been influenced by 
others too, that I've spoken to about this, that 
we're open to dialogue about it. And yes, I like 
to prepare my food at home. Because when you 
start eating this way, you want to know what's in 
your food. And when you go to a restaurant, you 
really don't know what's in your food, you don't 
know how much salt in it, you don't know how much 
oil is in it. You don't know what they've done 
with it in the kitchen, you don't know how fresh 
it is, frequently after food's been cooked, it's 
a little hard to tell, especially with 
vegetables, if they were fresh when they went in. 
Just things like that. So when I'm at home, and I 
can cook something, and I know everything that's 
in it, and I can leave things out, most 
specifically, I feel better. I feel like I've 
eaten something that my body can thrive on.
Mark O'Brien: And you're very good at, especially at home 
with minimizing cross or eliminating cross 
contamination where maybe in the restaurant, it's 
not, you don't know maybe you don't want to know, 
but it's one of those things that they're gonna 
cook your bean burger on the same grill, they 
probably cooked the hamburger. 
Chris O'Brien: Exactly.
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, I get that. So, I guess this drove you, 
you grow your own food here at home. But how long 
ago have you -- Did you try to grow food at all 
when you were younger? Was your, was your 
parents, say your mother or your dad into this? I 
know your mother liked to garden, but was she 
into? Was she into growing food? Or was it mostly 
flowers?
Chris O'Brien: Exactly that my mother had definitely would 
-- You would describe her as someone with a green 
thumb. She loved plants, she had house plants in 
the house that she took care of. And then she 
always, especially when I was younger, she took 
care of the yard. I mean, my parents had a lovely 
yard, and it was my mother's doing. But they even 
did other things like water features. And they, I 
mean, the yard was just spectacular, at least at 
the first house that I remember, as a child. We 
moved not long after that and some of the wind 
had gone out of them for recreating that 
environment in a new place. But she even then she 
still loved the plants and always, always had 
flowers and plants in the yard and cultivated a 
really, really nice appeal to the house.
Mark O'Brien: But it wasn't really food based, it was more 
of just aesthetics.
Chris O'Brien: In fact, to, to an extreme in the sense that 
my mother never wanted to grow food. But I did, 
even in that first house I just mentioned. I 
remember I had to prod her for a while and coax 
her into letting me, but she finally gave me a 
little piece of grass out in the back, ground was 
hard as rock, and told me that I could clear the 
grass out of that and plant a vegetable garden in 
it. And she may have helped me a little bit but 
my memory of it was that I was pretty much on my 
own to do it and I wasn't very old, I was 
probably only maybe six, seven years old -- ah, 
maybe eight in that range. And she, she kind of 
put me on my own and I planted vegetables out 
there and I remember I planted carrots and of 
course I didn't cultivate the soil enough for 
them to, it was hard as rock in places and for me 
to get any depth in there you know, it was it was 
not very possible at my age. So I was very, very... 
it was a disaster. It just it, I was able to grow 
some stuff came up and but then you know, it 
didn't it didn't feel right.
Mark O'Brien: So how long would you say you tried this? 
Chris O'Brien: Oh, it was just over one growing season, 
growing. 
Mark O'Brien: One growing season.
Chris O'Brien: So yeah, just over one growing season. It 
might not even have been the full growing season. 
And of course you know, if you don't stay active, 
if you don't keep on the tasks that are required 
for a garden, I mean, it goes back to what it was 
before you planted the garden really quickly. You 
your pets come in, you have the weeds come in, 
the grass comes back in if you don't water it in 
this Texas summer, it's gonna go really quick. 
So, you have to be very dedicated if you want to 
make it happen. 
Mark O'Brien: Okay, wow. And so, so then you have obviously 
you stopped doing that and you've gone through, 
you know, you go through high school and things, 
you none of it really started again until you 
moved. Did you do any? When you lived in 
Rockwall? Did you do any gardening or growing 
food in that situation or because at that point, 
you hadn't been a plant-based eater you really 
didn't worry about that?
Chris O'Brien: Yeah, I didn't, I actually, that put on the 
back burner because you as you know, I started, I 
became a mother very, very early in life. So, I 
had children to raise and then I went back to 
school to get my degree, I was doing that. So, I 
had a lot of diversions. I was not eating 
healthily. The next time that you know, really 
health and diet came into my world was when, this 
is crazy, but it was when cable TV first became 
available in Texas, because at that point, you 
could get content on cable television that talked 
about health and fitness and exercise and all 
those things and that's when that started to be 
planted again. There was a little bit of you 
know, spark in my mind that oh, I'm, I'm not 
doing things healthily. I'm not healthy.
Mark O'Brien: Right. 
Chris O'Brien: I need to exercise I need to do things like 
this. And that was in my, I would say mid 20s, 
early 20s when that happened.
Mark O'Brien: Excuse me. So, when you started with -- So 
now you get to the point where you're doing 
plant-based diet. Was there somebody that 
inspired you to start wanting to grow your own 
food? Or was this something that you develop just 
by? Was it a normal process? Or did you read 
somewhere that this might be the way to do it? I 
mean, how... what really got you started to do 
that?
Chris O'Brien: Well, one of the things that I do with my 
plant-based diet, and that I know is very 
important is to eat a lot of greens. So if 
you're...and this was something that came about to 
with my, with the whole process of becoming 
plant-based, is you don't, you know. You start 
out you're, you're not going to eat meat, well, 
what does that mean, I'm not going to eat meat, 
what means for most people, as they start out as 
they're going to eat around the meat, they're 
going to go to a restaurant, they're going to 
order everything that's around the meat, but 
they're not going to order the meat. That's not a 
balanced diet. And you find out really quickly 
that that's not a balanced diet, that you're not 
going to get the nutrients you need. And although 
you might be a little healthier, because you're 
not eating a lot of saturated fat and those kinds 
of things, you're still probably going to suffer 
for some other issues in the sense that you just 
don't have a well-rounded diet. You're -- 
everybody talks about protein. Protein is not a 
big issue. But that's another thing that people 
will tend to incline you to be concerned about 
whether you should be or not. So anyway, there's 
all those things. So you don't just flip a switch 
and have this happen. But one of the things once 
I matured into eating plant based, I knew I had 
to have beans, and I knew I had to have greens in 
my diet. And these things, although they're 
available in the grocery store, a lot of times 
they're not the freshest, and they're not always 
available, you might go to the grocery store, and 
there's not any kale. Or it's getting better now, 
but I'm talking about when I first started to, 
but even now with a better a lot of times the 
qualities not there. So, you kind of had to take 
something subpar, and try to create a meal out of 
it. And this is one of the foundations of your 
meal, your grains and your beans are the 
foundation and then of course your whole grains. 
So, I just started thinking, you know, I could 
grow kale plant. I -- you know, why don't I give 
that a try? I have no problem; I have inherited 
my mom's green thumb. I've been exposed to, you 
know, growing plants my whole life and I've, I've 
always had a nice yard, So I can grow kale. So, I 
decided to give it a try, and sure enough, I can 
grow kale.
Mark O'Brien: So I have to ask, you know, you go to a 
grocery store, and you go down the cereal aisle, 
and there's 500 I mean, I'm exaggerating, 
obviously, but 500 different brands of cereal you 
can pick from, which is one of the things I think 
people who come from other countries when they 
come to United States and we've talked about this 
in class. You know, they're so overwhelmed by the 
amount of choice we have, you know, and all the 
things that we buy. And I did relate to anecdotal 
story about when the Russians first came to 
Canada or to United States to play hockey and 
there was a couple of Russians in Canada, the 
captain of the Canucks took one of the wives of 
the Russian players to the grocery store to show 
her what it was like, and she was overwhelmed 
with choice. And so, when she saw the meat 
counter was full and full of meat, and she 
started putting it all in the in the basket. And 
she had to convince her, Stan Smyl's wife had to 
convince her it would be there tomorrow because 
in Russia, of course they didn't, they had 
scarcities like this. So, when you talk about 
things not being available, are -- In this 
situation. Are there different brands I mean of 
kale? Or is it like when you get it? Is there 
like is it farmed in different places? So there's 
two different brands you can pick from or our 
greens and vegetables, like you go to an apple 
stand and there's, you know, delicious and 
whatever apples they've got your crisp and in 
there different types of apples, which I'm not 
smart enough to know...they all taste like apples 
to me. But how about kale and greens? Is there 
different flavors depending on how they're grown 
or where they're grown.
Chris O'Brien: I don't know so much about how they're grown 
or where they're gone probably, um, I haven't 
investigated that honestly. But there are a lot 
of different varieties of greens and that's 
another thing I tried to incorporate is different 
not just kale, although I focus on kale.
Mark O'Brien: Right, right.
Chris O'Brien: Kale is probably one of my staples, but I'm 
also going to have spinach, I'm also going to 
have chard. There's, there's other ones as well, 
some are milder than others, some are more 
bitter, you know brussels sprouts is although 
another green, I consider it to be a green that 
I'll have, and also broccoli as another because 
those are in the kale family of cruciferous 
vegetables. So, like I center my -- I usually try 
to get some cruciferous vegetables, cruciferous 
vegetables in my diet every day. 
Mark O'Brien: And explain what that kind of vegetable does 
for you. 
Chris O'Brien: Um, it's just very, very nutritionally 
dense. So, you're gonna get a lot of nutrition 
out of that. You know, spinach is also, but it's 
not as nutritionally dense as kale is, and kale 
just, it's one of those ones that it's just a 
power food. 
Mark O'Brien: Okay, so you're getting a lot of bang for 
your buck, I guess when you're eating it. You 
don't have to have a lot of it. You can just eat.
Chris O'Brien: And you'd be surprised after you've eaten it 
for a little while. I know it has a bitter taste, 
I know a lot of folks have a genetic imposition 
to not like bitterness, but it kind of grows on 
you. It's just like --
Mark O'Brien: No pun intended. 
Chris O'Brien: Yes, I like it.
Mark O'Brien: Um, it's, I guess, it's like when people have 
salads and they put Iceberg lettuce in there. You 
know, they're not getting any nutritional value 
because it's white, not even green. You know? So 
I guess kale is the darker the green the better 
it is, I guess is what I'm hearing. 
Chris O'Brien: Exactly. 
Mark O'Brien: So when you first attempted to grow your own 
food were you were you here in, I mean, in this 
current, I'm trying to remember before I met you. 
If you had been growing food, I don't think you 
had been at that point. So, your first it, was 
your was your attempt before that, at some point, 
when you were living, you know, in Rockwall, 
let's say your condo.
Chris O'Brien: Its actually much later than that, and 
you'll probably remember when I tell you that my 
first attempt at growing food came out of a 
Christmas present. My son gave me.
Mark O'Brien: Oh, that's right, that's right.
Chris O'Brien: An Aero Garden.
Mark O'Brien: That's right, it was in the garage. Right? 
Chris O'Brien: Yeah, at first, I had on the counter in the 
kitchen. 
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, I do remember that. Yes. How could I 
forget?
Chris O'Brien: It has its flaws, and -- but it also has, 
you know, some, it works to an extent as well. 
But yeah, he bought me the Aero Garden, and I 
decided to try and grow some greens. And with 
that, and had some success, I also had some 
tomatoes in there and different things, some 
herbs, basil. And it was a lot of fun. But I 
quickly realized that growing plants indoors, 
although it works, you've -- it's, it's more than 
just putting something on your counter and having 
it do it for you so to speak. They were weaker, 
because they didn't have any pests, or any wind, 
or anything like that, to force them to become 
stronger plants. So then.
Mark O'Brien: So let me stop you there. So, you're saying 
that if you're if it's outside, it's like, almost 
like a human body, it has to develop immunities 
to certain things to survive, and so the more 
does that the stronger the ability of the plant 
or the product to survive this.
Chris O'Brien: Exactly. I wouldn't say that I'm a -- that 
I'm you know, necessarily authority on that 
subject. But yes, my limited amount of exposure 
to it so far, and then what I've witnessed 
myself, because, you know, I mean, I kind of use 
the garden as a chance to like experiment.
Mark O'Brien: Correct.
Chris O'Brien: Like, I don't always want to read about, I 
just want to see what happens, and so just being 
observant and watching what happens I've been 
able to see that, yes, they were plants respond 
to pass by becoming stronger, they and they even 
create components that make you healthier from 
eating them, because they have those things that 
they put out against pest in there that help you 
as well. And then of course, the wind helps them 
to be stronger in the sense that they just have 
to --
Mark O'Brien: Survive, or tip over of break I guess. 
Chris O'Brien: Don't just say you want to have a big, big 
fan blowing on your garden all the time, but it's 
just a part of the natural process. 
Mark O'Brien: Right, right, right. So, so you, so you have 
this aero garden in, in the, in the garage, and I 
remember when it went from the kitchen to the 
garage, and then, and then you decided at some 
point, I'm going to try to do this outside 
because I want to, I want more, I don't know, 
say....product, but you want a bigger yield, I 
guess is what.
Chris O'Brien: Exactly 
Mark O'Brien: The term you'd want to use. 
Chris O'Brien: Exactly. And then I use the aero garden a 
little bit, maybe for seeding for going ahead and 
starting my seeds early and then putting them out 
into the garden. And then I went from just using 
the grow light on the arrow garden in order to do 
seeds and put them out in the garden, and that 
worked really well. Ah, but I also like just 
going out in the garden, poking a seed in the 
ground, and waiting to see what happens.
Mark O'Brien: And have you noticed any difference between 
those two methods? Or have they been --
Chris O'Brien: I think seeding my garden outside is 
probably the most robust way to do it. Some 
plants don't transplant well, they don't like to 
be, like this year is my first year to try a 
stock of corn, and I knew that I needed to put 
that in the ground, I couldn't put it in the 
garden into the garage, and get it started and 
then --
Mark O'Brien: Right, right.
Chris O'Brien: Transplant it into the garden, expect to 
have the same success, if any, so I just put it 
out there. And sometimes I try to be a little 
risky and say, oh, you know, I can't put this out 
until this time till the soils this temperature. 
You know, I experiment a little bit. And so far, 
I've got a nice stalk with corn growing.
Mark O'Brien: So, would you say your education on this has 
been from strictly experience of what you've 
tried? Is it come from any... has there been basis 
of some sort of book learning or reading? And 
then you try it? I mean, what was the Neil Sperry 
you know, the garden guy, but I don't know if 
that had anything to do with --
Chris O'Brien: Vegetables?
Mark O'Brien: Vegetables. I think it was just garden. I 
remember listening to when I first came to Texas 
on the radio, and it was just people calling up 
about certain plants and trees that were in 
survival. I never heard anybody say I can't grow 
my kale. But, you know, where did this education 
deal from? Did you? Was it because you had to? 
Um, you let -- you read about it and said I'm 
going to try it, or because the Aero Garden was 
so good. You thought well, let me just try to 
bigger in a bigger environment, and I'll just 
experiment out there like I was with the Aero 
Garden where did it really? What was the genesis 
of your education for this?
Chris O'Brien: Ah, it was actually kind of, you know, not 
to use a pun word here, organic. I mean, I didn't 
just set out with this idea that I'm going to 
become a gardener. It's just been something 
that's crept into my life. Um, I had my starts, 
and I had some success. I had some failure. I 
mean, I you know I had aphids, like I've never 
seen before in my life and you know, just 
different things in this but it's always 
intrigued me each step of the way. I've been 
intrigued a little bit more I was like, oh, next 
time I'll try this, of course, next time is not 
tomorrow. Next time is next season.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: Or the next opportunity I have. So, you have 
plenty of time for your brain to, you know, sit, 
and chew on it and think about how you might do 
it differently. Or you might be -- you do go 
ahead and seek out some, some information. But 
I'm always careful, like, I want to read about 
how you're supposed to do it., but I also want to 
kind of figure it out on my own, just a little 
bit, because, you know, that's the only way I 
might accidentally stumble onto something even 
better than what I read and so I don't want to be 
too anchored on everything that I read. Ah, I 
just enjoy, I, that this is the whole thing with 
biology in general, I just enjoy watching it 
happen and being really, really, you know, 
impressed by what can happen, ah, with plants, 
they impressed me. 
Mark O'Brien: So, so it sounds like this is mostly just cut 
and try and you know just.
Chris O'Brien: Now look, you know it's not totally trial 
and error. 
Mark O'Brien: There you go, totally trial and error yeah...
Chris O'Brien: It not totally trial and error, I, I can't, 
you know, I've done a lot like, I've done the 
reading with regards to you know, I gotta keep 
the soil in good condition. So, for me, that has 
not been any kind of slash and burn, or some of 
the things that you might read about. I've been 
using compost, and that's another area that I 
need to get myself up to speed on. I've struggled 
with it, I it hasn't been one of those things 
that I found easy, I've tried a couple of things 
at first, that just didn't work at all. And I'm 
trying different things now with some of my 
scraps in the kitchen and just, you know, again, 
it has to get to a maturity level with it's not, 
and that's part of the fun, I mean, you're not 
going to just all of a sudden decide to say, I'm 
going to compost and then have.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: This wonderful compost.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: It takes time. And it's a process and you 
just have to kind of get to where you enjoy the 
process of it.
Mark O'Brien: So how much I mean, Am, I was gonna say that 
-- I'll save that question for later. So, if you 
-- What have you found that limits your ability 
to, to grow something here, and we can talk from 
a different, a couple of different perspectives? 
Let's talk about space, is there a limitation to 
what you can grow? Because certain...certain crops 
would, or products would require more space? Or 
because you're really, you're really just 
somewhat growing for sustainability, right? 
You're not, you're not, you're just, you're just 
growing what you can eat, you're not necessarily 
trying to grow to go sell it at the farmers 
market in downtown Dallas.
Chris O'Brien: Exactly.
Mark O'Brien: So, you don't need a big huge 12 acre plot. 
But given what you have in the backyard, is there 
enough? I mean, is there something that you don't 
grow because you don't have enough room?
Chris O'Brien: Ah, I don't think I grow at the total, at 
the scale I would -- I still need the grocery 
store. I mean, I, and I need the grocery store 
for my vegetables and mainly for my fruits. Ah. 
So I'm not, I'm not anywhere near a point where I 
could just go off the grid and supply my own food 
source. I mean, I'm not growing any grains, 
mainly when I'm growing as grains, so... so they're 
large plants, and they're fun to grow. And then 
like I said, I'm taking a foray into corn, I've 
got a little bit of carrots, I've got herbs, you 
know, I have the mint, my mint does wonderful. I 
have basil that I use and I'm actually addicted 
to fresh basil. 
Mark O'Brien: Didn't you try tomatoes back at the condo 
also?
Chris O'Brien: I did, I had tried tomatoes. And again, this 
is where my, my desire --
Mark O'Brien: And that caterpillar was eating it up for 
some, whatever that was, yeah.
Chris O'Brien: That was actually a very interesting piece 
for me. I mean, I had planted the tomatoes and I 
had struggled with them and I had them in pretty 
good shape. And then here comes this 
caterpillars, and they literally ate every single 
leaf off that entire...
Mark O'Brien: I remember that. At the townhome.
Chris O'Brien: Tomato plant. It was intrigued by it; I 
could have pulled them off. But again, this is 
where I enjoy the process and watching things. I 
want to see what happened. 
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: And what happened was they ate the whole 
tomato plant. And then they went on their merry 
way to become moth and the tomato plant came back 
and it came back as strong or stronger, and it 
even produced fruit now that fruit never, never 
ripen because the cool weather came and it ran 
out of time. 
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: I could have done some... going back now 
knowing what I know, now I could have done 
something different. I could have covered that 
plan or found some way to, you know, create some 
kind of a greenhouse environment for it and ripen 
that fruit. But it was stronger, and I, I took 
away from that, that's one thing I go back to for 
resilience. That plant gave me a lesson in 
resilience. You know, you can come back from 
things. 
Mark O'Brien: Un-huh.
Chris O'Brien: And here's a lowly little tomato plant is 
teaching me about, you know, being resilient.
Mark O'Brien: Life?
Chris O'Brien: Un-huh.
Mark O'Brien: So, let me go back, you mentioned a few 
minutes ago, excuse me that you had to, you still 
rely on the grocery store, obviously, because you 
can't grow everything in the backyard. As far as 
fruits and vegetables go, but do you notice a 
difference If you buy something say kale, let's 
say sometimes you go to the store and I know you 
bring kale back. Do you notice a difference in 
the taste between what you bring back from the 
store and what you grow in the backyard? 
Chris O'Brien: Well, let's look at that from a different 
perspective. I noticed that difference in the 
appearance.
Mark O'Brien: Okay.
Chris O'Brien: Tremendous. I mean, I go and pull a kale 
leaf, now granted the way I harvest my kale is 
one leaf or two a, a time.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: So, I harvest from the bottom, the plant 
stays vibrant the plant still produces, and I can 
eat off that one plant because I have some very 
large kale plants for a long time. So, I bring, I 
can go out there and I can cut a leaf and it is 
literally perfect. And it's fresh.
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: It's, it hasn't spent a single day yet, in 
an environment outside, if it's natural, and I 
bring it in and I chop it up and I put it in my 
food. There's no comparison to that with what you 
buy, first of all, they're not even very well 
equipped at most of the stores I see for, for 
selling kale in a way that doesn't damage it. 
It's the, what this shelving that they use, they 
shove it into these spaces, and it gets damaged. 
So, you have broken leaves, and they're start to 
wilt, and sometimes I can coax them back, I bring 
them back, I trim them, I trim like fresh 
flowers, and I stick them in the fridge, and they 
come back a little bit because they are still 
alive.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: They are not dead, and then I can eat them 
and feel somewhat good about it. But in general, 
it never, never compares to I get out my garden.
Mark O'Brien: Would, would you say that with other things 
too at the grocery store like spinach and fresh. 
I don't know what else they would have, their 
okra and things like that. Do you find it to be 
the maybe. I won't say leave it too late, but 
just the environment of growing it wherever they 
grow up putting it in a truck and driving it to 
the store and then trying to make it.
Chris O'Brien: You know, it does.
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, I mean, you figure it's gonna take at 
least the best case four or five days to get from 
where it is to the store. And then they got to 
put it on the store. So, it's probably been 
picked for a week before you get to it. I'm just 
--
Chris O'Brien: No, and a lot of people wouldn't even notice 
this because they haven't maybe they're one piece 
of the chain, but they're not at the beginning of 
the chain when they saw that plant when it was 
first harvested and what it looked like then to 
all the way to the end, when they see the person 
who's buying and what it looks like then. 
Obviously sometimes that chain can be really 
short, you know, maybe the kale is just coming 
from some local --
Mark O'Brien: Right, right, right.
Chris O'Brien: Farmer here in the area and it's really 
short you get lucky. 
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: Other times you mean as you know, some 
berries and things like that you go from the 
grocery store coming from Chile or --
Mark O'Brien: Right, oh yeah.
Chris O'Brien: Really far away and you know it's been a 
long time.
Mark O'Brien: Fruit comes from California. And it's just 
yeah, yeah, 
Chris O'Brien: Yeah.
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, yeah, no, it's true. So now you have a 
garden in the backyard, and actually you have, 
I'm sorry, you have a garden on the -- In the 
flowerbed. But then you have a garden stand, I 
guess, I guess that's what I would call it next 
to the house.
Chris O'Brien: Like a little raise -- raised bed. 
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, a raised bed. How is that? How, do you 
notice difference between the two and that they 
both, I mean obviously not the same depth on the 
stand, but do you need that kind of depth to 
grow? 
Chris O'Brien: Oh, I think a stand is gonna, it's gonna 
inhibited me a little bit because number one, you 
know, my flower bed that I found I had happened 
to have a nice location that was confined that 
got a lot of sun, and it was a bed itself. You've 
got earthworms, you have all kinds of an 
ecosystem in that soil, you're not going to 
reproduce that ecosystem and a container.
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: Or is very difficult to, and that container 
is going to be submitted to Texas heat is, is 
tremendous, and it's going to have it on all the 
corners all around the outside surface of it. So 
that soil is going to heat up more than soil and 
the ground would heat up, so you're not, you're 
just not going to have the same level of, of an 
ecosystem there. So, I tend towards wanting to do 
the no till, and where I don't disturb the soil 
too much when I plant something, because I want 
all that stuff in the soil that's going to help 
it to be healthy.
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: Because I'm going to be eating what's coming 
out of it. Ah, which leads me into the next foray 
into my adventure, which is to have my soil 
tested.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: And make sure that I do -- don't have any, 
you know, things in my soil that I may not want; 
and if I do I take measures to remember that, 
because I'm just getting to the scale now where 
that when might concern me when I was just 
getting a leaf or two here and there, it's still 
a concern, but I want to kick this further and 
eat more and more stuff that I have grown. 
Mark O'Brien: So, you mentioned earlier when you talked 
about, excuse me. The slash and burn effect, you 
know, we studied that in class, like the Milpa in 
Yucatan where they will grow their food and then 
in the offseason, they cut it down, they burn it 
to enrich the soil. Um, how do you do that here? 
I mean the, I know you said you don't do that. 
But how would you, I mean, I'm not saying I guess 
you're not growing, isn't it you're not growing 
enough quantity, at the same time that would 
drain the soil of nutrients or --
Chris O'Brien: Oh no, I have to watch it because --
Mark O'Brien: So, you have to be careful how you, how you 
grow and what you --
Chris O'Brien: Yes. And I'm approaching that now in the 
sense that I'm going to need to rotate. I can't 
grow the same stuff in the soil, over and over.
Mark O'Brien: Right, right. That's my, yeah, okay.
Chris O'Brien: I needed to rotate, I need to probably give 
them a rest on some soil, and that's where we 
come into this space constraints, right?
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: Because I don't have a ton of space. 
Mark O'Brien: You can't, you can't go somewhere else on the 
yard and grow there for a while. Well, this one 
take, yeah.
Chris O'Brien: Exactly, and like I mentioned before, I 
don't really want to till too much. I don't want 
to turn up the soil and that that's it. So even 
though I'm composting and I'm trying to get to a 
level where I can reintroduce, um, organics into 
my soil again, and replenish it which I use now 
with worm casings, and some, you know, various 
things that you can get it at the gardening 
store, but I want to use compost as well, and 
then I can enrich my soil again. But then I have 
to kind of, I have to incorporate those 
ingredients. And that's going to take a little 
bit if I want to protect that ecosystem as well. 
So then I am going to need more space, I'm gonna 
have to say, oh, I need to rest this one maybe 
for season and plant or I need to swap where my 
herbs were maybe come over here and where my 
herbs, where I had my herbs, I put my kale. But 
then there, those are whole grains. I have some 
studying to do.
Mark O'Brien: Sure.
Chris O'Brien: But I'm looking forward to that, figuring it 
out.
Mark O'Brien: And, I think what's fascinating is it sounds 
like very similar to things you read about, and I 
don't want to get too dramatic, but ancient, old 
civilizations or people that have been growing on 
the lands for years that they have to learn how 
to manage that land, this is, yours is just a 
little bit of a smaller microcosm of what, what 
this larger problem is, you know I'm sure farms 
have the same issue, um.
Chris O'Brien: Oh, absolutely.
Mark O'Brien: So, with all this, you know living in Texas, 
you know I'm from California, where the sun is 
out a lot, and your temperatures, I mean, if 
you're. Well, if you're on the coast, and they 
get into the hundreds, it's a big deal. But in 
the Central Valley, where most of the growing of 
crops is in California, it can get into 100 
degrees, maybe not quite the intensity we have in 
Texas, but it can be pretty warm. Do you find 
things here, are there certain things you can't 
grow, or you have to be careful about based on 
the weather, that the unpredictable weather 
patterns sometimes, or even just the hot summers 
in Texas? 
Chris O'Brien: Yeah, we have a challenge when it gets 
really hot, like last year, I had issues because 
we have so many days that were over 100 degrees, 
and even up to like 108 and more, with the sun 
just going to burn your plants up. 
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: So but I found techniques, you know, I 
actually created a shade tent for my plants and I 
put them over them for some of the tougher time 
periods, in late July and August, and that 
worked, it was very helpful and kept some of the 
moisture in the soil coming from drying out so 
much, and it kept the heat off of them. The thing 
I'm trying next too is to have things that shade 
each other. So, you know, like my corn stock.
Mark O'Brien: Uh huh.
Chris O'Brien: It's, It's just a very small foray into it, 
but that is part of my thinking is that it's 
going to get big and taller and I can potentially 
use that for some a little bit of shade and the 
others and I'm thinking what else can I use, that 
would over the growing period, maybe provide some 
shade. Um, but then also, you have to think about 
too, there's some things you can't grow in Texas, 
because the soul content, the alkalinity of the 
soil is not conducive, like I would love to grow 
blueberries, I could grow blueberries, but I 
would plan to do it in a container, or I'd have 
to be very specific about a place that I chose to 
do it and I'd have to monitor the soil in order 
to --
Mark O'Brien: So that they wouldn't grow or they would 
grow, they would be like, really small or they 
wouldn't be very tasty. And what caused, what, 
what limits.
Chris O'Brien: They probably would just struggle.
Mark O'Brien: Oh, ok.
Chris O'Brien: They would struggle in it without the right 
content in the soil, and the right alkalinity, 
they would struggle. And so I wouldn't get the 
good crop. The whole point is to get something 
better that you can get in the grocery store.
Mark O'Brien: Right, right, right.
Chris O'Brien: In the end. I mean, it just doesn't make any 
sense to have a plant or even in a person or an 
animal, and feed them, which is what you're 
essentially doing with the soil of a plant, 
what's not right for them, you know, if you want 
them to thrive... So, I would love to try 
blueberries, I would probably need to move to do 
it right. 
Mark O'Brien: Could you grow, um, you know, I grew up -- my 
mother -- my grandmother lived in Washington 
state up near, outside of Renton and she had a 
cherry tree in her backyard, and we would go out 
as kids. I remember visiting her and we would eat 
the cherries off the tree. Of course, we had to 
try to beat the birds to it, you would get the 
cherry off and there would be a slice in it from 
the bird. Is there any kind of fruit like that 
that you've considered growing here in Texas? I 
don't know that, does fruit like that grow well 
in Texas, I, I don't know.
Chris O'Brien: Well, that and that's kind of one of the 
beauties too about having these different areas, 
right, that you go there, and there's something 
that you can't get at home. That's wonderful 
there.
Mark O'Brien: Right. 
Chris O'Brien: Maybe you can't reproduce that at home, but 
that's why people travel and it's why they trade, 
right? 
Mark O'Brien: Sure.
Chris O'Brien: But yes, I mean, if I wanted to grow some 
fruit here, I could but I'd probably pick 
something that was more conducive to the 
environment, you know, peaches or pomegranates or 
something that I can grow here. Ah, the hot 
summers are always going to impact my growing. I 
mean, it's just, it's hard on plants.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: That hot of the summer. But by the same 
token, I have a longer growing season. I can 
start earlier, and I can end later, and, if I can 
make it through that sometimes I can even go over 
the winter. If I tried to like this past year, I 
was able to keep all my kale and greens alive 
through the winter. And they're, they've come 
back really stronger than they were last year by 
a huge margin. 
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, I remember.
Chris O'Brien: I was just waiting for the pest to come now. 
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, so, remember going out there before the 
frost and the... the cold snaps to cover it up. 
Yeah, we see you see it. You know that when 
someone's covering their plants, you probably 
cover your greens, right? 
Chris O'Brien: Oh, absolutely. 
Mark O'Brien: So.
Chris O'Brien: Although they are pretty hardy, they are 
frost tolerant, most kale and --
Mark O'Brien: Oh, really? 
Chris O'Brien: Yes, frost tolerant. I don't have to go out 
and just cover it. Now my corn is not frost, so 
you have to kind of think about that too when 
you're mixing up your garden. 
Mark O'Brien: That's why you don't record an Iowa in the 
wintertime. It's only exists in the summer. Um, 
but did, to grow, like to grow, say a peach tree, 
I mean, would you need quite a bit of.
Chris O'Brien: You need space! 
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, I mean, you couldn't put one like, 
you've got the maple, you can't see this on, the 
on, on the, the on the audio but you've got 
maples in the backyard we take one of the maples 
out.
Chris O'Brien: No. No. No.
Mark O'Brien: And put in an apple tree, but then you 
wouldn't want to take the maple out, right?
Chris O'Brien: No, I love all my, all my plants are equally 
loved, but yeah, my maples are dear to me I 
wouldn't take one out but I would, I have 
considered planting a fruit tree, yes.
Mark O'Brien: There's a spot in front where there's an 
open.
Chris O'Brien: Yeah. 
Mark O'Brien: Where a tree use to be.
Chris O'Brien: It could get a little crazy, I have to watch 
myself. 
Mark O'Brien: Yeah. Um, so the, so one of the other things 
I wanted to also talk about was, so at the church 
that we attended, we, that we attend, they 
started that we go through Dallas when we lived 
in downtown, and I think you first started, the 
Genesis was when we lived downtown, we were 
trying to find a place to grow things. 
Chris O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Mark O'Brien: And they wanted to have these community 
gardens which you see all over the place that, 
they're not like ubiquitous, you can't, every 
corner there isn't one. But there's one over by 
the church here just around the corner from us, 
and there was some downtown, and we did try this 
at... at the church where we had a number of the 
community gardens. Do you think those are 
feasible things for a metropolitan urban area to 
work on? Or do you think that that requires, it, 
it. It's a hobby more than it is someone that's 
going to be sustainable, grow sustainable food, 
as I kind of look at it. As people looked at it 
as a hobby, but I don't, I don't know of anybody 
that actually has a community garden and they go 
down and they actually pick, they pick the fruit 
to go eat it because, like when the one we saw in 
Boston, for example, over by the Fenway Park, it 
was huge, it was huge. 
Chris O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Mark O'Brien: A lot of them were flowers, though I didn't 
see a lot of food.
Chris O'Brien: Yes, they were growing flowers.
Mark O'Brien: Yeah, but I mean, I'm just wondering if 
that's something... How do you how do you envision 
the community gardens? I mean, you've worked with 
it for a while.
Chris O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Mark O'Brien: Down in East Dallas. What were the 
limitations with that? And what were the 
positives with that? 
Chris O'Brien: I was excited about it when we first 
proposed to do that at church. And, and as they 
got, got it going, and everything, of course 
there was a lot of hands in it.
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: And as you know, I mean, I'm still 
experimenting,
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: And so, I'm trying to figure this some of 
this stuff out on my own. Would I benefit from 
having a community of people? Yes. I think I 
would, I think that part would be good. But then... 
then you get the thing where it's like, okay, 
when I want to work in my garden, I have to pack 
up and head somewhere, right? 
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: I have to get a car. 
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: And I tend to like go outside and work with 
my plants, it's therapeutic. Adding that trip, 
that commute to, it is going to distract from it, 
and then you've got your tools that you need. Um, 
and then you know, it's just a little bit, 
there's some, a little bit of a difference to it. 
Right? You get there and you get, I don't know, I 
like the idea that I can go out just before I'm 
eating and decide what I'm going to harvest and 
bring it back into my kitchen and cook it.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: So, am I potentially going to do a community 
gardens, just because I need the space? Possibly. 
Most of them I've looked at there, they're doing 
raised beds and, you know, I can certainly go out 
and plant a community garden and maybe meet some 
folks that are doing the same thing. I am... have 
like minds, and that's probably something I will 
get into because it seems like it would be 
beneficial, but right now it's kind of having fun 
doing it in the backyard and the whole space that 
I have.
Mark O'Brien: And so then, maybe this isn't the right 
question to ask. So, is there a way to do this? 
And I guess I'm thinking in the terms of someone 
trying to grow in an area where there isn't a lot 
of dirt, like we have a backyard, you know, is 
there, is there any kind of process that you can 
grow something in an environment that doesn't 
have a sor -- a natural soil that you have, like 
out of the backyard? I mean, maybe you put 
something on top of the apartment building, you 
know.
Chris O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Mark O'Brien: And you just drag mulch up there or something 
like that. I don't, I don't know, even know what 
it would be, you know, is that does that limit 
your ability to really grow good food? 
Chris O'Brien: Well, I think you can do all that, and I 
think even that people should have explored it, 
because I mean, even though it might not be 
perfect. It's better than nothing.
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: And significantly better than nothing and 
you might stumble on something really great. I 
mean, we have to explore and experiment and try 
different things. At the end of the day, do I 
think the plants need to be in the ground? Yes, I 
think they need to be in the ground. Like we 
mentioned, you can do the container gardening to 
an extent, but I don't think you can take it to 
the level that I would eventually like to be at, 
and then also you mentioned other type things, 
you know, there is a hydroponic which is what the 
Aero Garden was based off.
Mark O'Brien: Right. 
Chris O'Brien: And that's something that another... another 
way that you can grow food but again, you have to 
incorporate some ways to keep this plant strong. 
I mean, though, you don't want your plants to get 
eaten up by pests. I mean I've got a beautiful, 
beautiful set of greens out there and I know the 
pests are coming because --
Mark O'Brien: They always do.
Chris O'Brien: I've already seen caterpillars. I know 
they're coming, and I want to stay organic so I'm 
not going to put anything on there. I'm going to 
depend on the plants and a little bit of, ah, 
interference on my part to help them along as 
much as I can, but I'm gonna depend on them. You 
take all that away, and I don't think you have 
the same, and that's just part of, ah...the 
challenges, and part of the... what it means to try 
to garden.
Mark O'Brien: So, okay, so now I'll ask another... and this 
is another... this is actually for my own personal 
edification was, you see people in the grocery 
store that say...excuse me.... that, well, this has 
grown organically versus some other product. Are 
they strictly there talking about pesticides and 
how they keep the bugs off of it. So organic 
would be like you're doing in the backyard, that 
you're not spraying anything, you just have to 
kind of keep an eye on, on the, on the little 
critters that are gonna come in and try and eat 
your... your...
Chris O'Brien: Eat my food?
Mark O'Brien: Eat your food, and figure out how to minimize 
the damage that in this...
Chris O'Brien: In some cases, I have to share a little bit. 
Mark O'Brien: Right, right. Right, and is that what they're 
really they're talking about when they say 
difference from organic...
Chris O'Brien: That, and fertilizer.
Mark O'Brien: Because everything is grown. Yeah, everything 
has grown. I mean, it's organic from the ground. 
But...
Chris O'Brien: True, but yes, you're talking about the fact 
that I haven't used pesticides, and I haven't 
used fertilizer, per se, I've used some kind of 
compost, and I've used something that's natural...
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: As opposed to just, ah.. chemicals.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: You know... that I went out and purchased. And 
then flood on the garden, to give nutrients to my 
plans, which tend to use a spark overgrows and 
things get stringy, they're just not as healthy. 
There is just no shortcut. I mean, we want to 
create a shortcut, and maybe there are some, you 
know, there are some shortcuts, but there is a 
give and take for each one of them. At the end of 
the day, you just got to go out there and you 
have to get your hands dirty, and you have to 
live with the pests, and you have to live with 
the failures sometimes and then come back. But 
you know, again, we still have that grocery 
store. There's times...
Mark O'Brien: Oh, yeah.
Chris O'Brien: When people were doing this, and they didn't 
have the grocery store. It was the... it was this 
or starve. So naturally, we've evolved to have 
these safeguards, you know, the... the pesticides 
and the... it... between starving and... and you know, 
using them, you probably go with using them, but 
we're evolving to a point I hope where we can 
eliminate those and still not starve, and that's 
where you see organics coming in. There're more 
expensive and all of this but...
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: It's something I think that we need to 
support as a, as a people.
Mark O'Brien: So, given all this you've done to grow your 
own food, and it shows the extent that you have, 
and things you'd like to do in the future. What 
have you seen to be the biggest limitation? And 
then what have you seen to be the biggest 
advantage of what you've been doing here?
Chris O'Brien: It's been a tremendous advantage to me, just 
the learning, and the watching and the being 
amazed, and having fun with it, and then in... in 
the midst of all the fun, you get something yummy 
to eat. It's just so rewarding, it's hard work. 
Hard work is always rewarding. In the end, I 
think you know, you feel good about it, even if 
you fail, you still feel good about it, so enjoy 
that. The limitations for me, you know, the basic 
ones, right, which I think everyone would find 
that they have, is time, having the time for the 
unpredictability of the weather, ah...
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: And then also, you know, it's just, I don't 
know, it's just a hard thing to do. 
Mark O'Brien: Well, I guess I would look at it, and yes, 
and I guess that's the term I would look at is.... 
growing your own food, you have to be, I think, 
committed...
Chris O'Brien: Uh-huh, very much so.
Mark O'Brien: You know, you can't just start growing it and 
say, I'm not gonna worry about it today. 
Chris O'Brien: Yeah. No, you can't.
Mark O'Brien: I mean....you look, you look at people in the 
past who've had farms or even... even they study, 
the people that in many other countries that are 
growing food, indigenous people that have grown 
their own food, and, you know, they work at it 
every day, and you.... they go out into the field 
every day and they do stuff. And even if you're 
in an urban environment, you still have to do 
that, I think I can see that as a limitation for 
many people from starting to try to grow their 
own food. 
Chris O'Brien: Somebody has to do it.
Mark O'Brien: And other than that... exactly, other than 
that, they want to go have a hamburger, as 
opposed to eating a salad, say every day.
Chris O'Brien: Right. 
Mark O'Brien: But... so, I really appreciate the time you've 
taken, I'd, I'd like to ask you one more question 
and that is -- what do you see? And I know this 
is a hard one, and we talked about it before we 
started. But what is your vision of, of, of the 
future of food growth in -- and when I say food 
growth? I mean, more sustainable food growth in 
the sense of people that maybe will try to go off 
on their own to grow food in North Texas. Do you 
think that? Do you know enough people? Do you 
have friends that even tried to do this? Or do 
you think it's... you see around but in your own 
personal opinion, do you think it's possible for 
people to... to really be able to expand where they 
are in... in -- I'm sorry, where they're living 
and be able to maybe be a little sustainable in 
their own in, in their own way with some of the 
food? 
Chris O'Brien: That's a tough one. I mean, just knowing 
what I know....is involved in how it's a process. 
Ah, like we started out with the fact that I'm -- 
I eat a plant-based diet, and do I see more 
people, because I see that as being the impetus 
for my garden.
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: Right? I became plant base. I had trouble 
finding foods that I wanted to eat that were 
fresh. I wanted them to be better. So, I started 
growing a garden, it's the things came together 
in that scenario, and -- but then it also go -- 
went back to my childhood and the fact that I had 
some -- I knew I could do this, I'd seen it 
happen. I don't know that everybody...not everybody 
has that trajectory in their lives and... but as 
people become more plant based, I think they are 
going to start thinking about this and I do think 
people are realizing the benefits of eating more 
fruits and vegetables. Then you take in the fact 
that our urban areas, I mean, we have to factor 
this into their design, we can't you know, as we 
sequester people more and more into apartments.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: And that type of living, you're going to 
have -- and I've seen this, there's been some 
communities going in downtown area where they 
incorporated farming into it, there's not, it's 
perfectly possible and even, you know, a good 
thing to consider. You're building a housing 
development, put in some farmland, let folks in 
the housing development that be part of the 
community, that you're gonna grow food, and maybe 
it's a small subset of the community that does 
that, and maybe they help to support the others, 
who knows, I mean, I see that as another avenue. 
For those folks living in apartments, something 
similar could be devised,
Mark O'Brien: Uh-huh.
Chris O'Brien: And, you don't have to get in your car and 
drive, you know, 15 or 20 minutes to get to your 
garden that you're in the community with, it's 
right there, you walk outside your house, you 
meet your neighbors, not people that are you 
know... and that would work perfectly. Ah, I would 
love to see that right now, as you know, living 
in a typical community in an urban area, gardens 
aren't pretty.
Mark O'Brien: Right.
Chris O'Brien: Like they don't, they don't bloom and look 
wonderful.
Mark O'Brien: Right, right, right.
Chris O'Brien: And they can be you know, kind of, you know, 
awful looking at times this as the process goes. 
So, they I can be attractive too, but don't get 
me wrong, but they're not what people are used to 
seeing.
Mark O'Brien: There are not always in neat rows down the -- 
yeah, yeah.
Chris O'Brien: Exactly, and so we need to start thinking 
about gardening differently like that, you know, 
like I couldn't really, in our neighborhood, as 
you well know, plant corn out in the front yard. 
People would frown on that. But I think we can 
evolve. 
Mark O'Brien: Good. Well, I think everybody realizes, um, 
I'm sure most people -- even I, when I was 
little, my brothers, sisters tried to grow this 
little packet seeds you buy --
Chris O'Brien: Oh yes, they do grow.
Mark O'Brien: And put them in the yard, and you do try to 
try to grow things you know, and you try to grow 
a carrot and see how that tastes, but I will say 
that I think, I personally, as someone who's not 
driven to eat a lot of vegetables.
Chris O'Brien: I know.
Mark O'Brien: I, I would say that I've been -- in some of 
my travels when I was in the Midwest working, 
when I first started working and I would be 
invited over to my friends, these people that I 
worked with, my colleagues their homes and they 
were farmers, they lived on farms, that there was 
a huge difference in the taste between fresh 
beans and fresh broccoli, um.
Chris O'Brien: Yes.
Mark O'Brien: And fresh corn, even though I kind of stop 
eating that for other reasons, but, but fresh 
food out of a garden is so much better than what 
people get in cans. I think there's a lot of 
people in the world that don't realize how fresh 
and good that can taste because they're either -- 
They're too busy going to the store buying it in 
can.
Chris O'Brien: Correct is the difference between something 
that's alive and easting something that died 
quite a while ago. 
Mark O'Brien: Exactly. So. well, I appreciate the time, and 
that'll be it for this interview, and I hope that 
people who are listening that you've enjoyed it. 
Thank you.
Chris O'Brien: Thank you.
