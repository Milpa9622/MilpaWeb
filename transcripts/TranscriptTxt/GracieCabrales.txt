Interviewer: Gabriella Cabrales       Date: May 6th, 2024

Place of Interview: Denton, Texas




Gabriella Cabrales: Hello, my name is Gabriella Cabrales. I am a student here at UNT and I am with my younger sister Gracie Cabrales. Gracie, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
Gracie Cabrales: Hi, I'm Gracie. I'm ohh. Wait. No, you already know that [I’m] your sister. I’m 17. I'm a senior at DHS and I also attend a culinary class at LaGrone Academy.
Gabriella Cabrales: Wonderful. Can you tell me where?... Obviously, I know this, but for, you know, everybody else. Can you tell me where you're from?
Gracie Cabrales: I’m from Denton, Texas, born and raised.
Gabriella Cabrales: And so, you're currently still here in Denton, Texas. 
Gracie Cabrales: Yes. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Wonderful. Can you tell me -- at the beginning of our class, our professor liked to ask us a question, and I think it's very fitting to ask you the same question. What is your favorite dish and why?
Gracie Cabrales: I would like to say my favorite dish forever and always will be just the basic spaghetti and meat sauce because I grew up with it and I always remember this one time back when I was in preschool. Any time I'd get in the car with my dad, I would ask him.
Gracie Cabrales: If we were having spaghetti tonight and I'd always get super excited every time, he did say that I did get spaghetti that night. It was a core memory to me. 
Gabriella Cabrales: You have always been obsessed with spaghetti.
Gracie Cabrales: Yes, yes. 
Gabriella Cabrales: I do know that. OK. And again, I know this, but for the audience, what was your food like growing up? Well, you know, what were dinners like, what were lunches like, do you think you have any sort of emotional connection to the certain foods that you grew up with?
Gracie Cabrales: Um, I mean we kind of grew up a lot with fast food and stuff so if anything, I feel like I always kind of -- I don't want to say robbed, but like I would definitely like if I were to like, look at like our cousins, 
Gabriella Cabrales: Right.
Gracie Cabrales: Aristeo and Xochi, they grew up on a more like homemade like stuff and they know how to, like, cook them some and we're not so much. You know?
Gabriella Cabrales: Right.
Gracie Cabrales: But, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I don't really want to say that I have much of a connection unless it's like spaghetti or mac and cheese because that makes me think of Grandma. Yeah.
Gabriella Cabrales: That makes sense. That's really interesting. You say that. Are you talking about Grandma Rita or Grandma Emma? 
Gracie Cabrales: Grandma Emma.
Gabriella Cabrales: Grandma Emma is our grandmother from our father's side. And I think it's really interesting you say that because when I think of food associated to her, I think of grilled cheese. Instead of mac and cheese.
Gracie Cabrales: I also remember grilled cheese that made me.
Gabriella Cabrales: Yeah.
Gracie Cabrales: Forget it out there. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great grilled cheese. OK, so as you were saying about how you, you know, you feel like you got robbed, you know, in a way and how like the food growing up, a lot of it was fast food, do you think -- the food you -- we ate growing up had an impact on your decision to go the culinary route?
Gracie Cabrales: I don't want to say the food we ate had the impact. I think I just got that anytime I were to watch Hell's Kitchen with mom, and you know we'd always sit there and watch these, like, people just whip up food with literally anything. And I thought that kind of inspired me because I want to do something like that so -- No, but no. I don't think it was the food that really inspired me to go into culinary. However, it does drive me because now that I know like seeing other people in my culinary class with like experience because of their families cooking at home and makes me want to be like. “Well, well, I'm gonna learn a freaking lot because I'm not just gonna be eating McDonald's my whole life. That's crazy talk.” Yeah.
Gabriella Cabrales: Right. And you cook at home, a lot more now.
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Right. Like you cook for the family. 
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah, like tomorrow. I'm making fettuccini Alfredo with broccoli and chicken.
Gabriella Cabrales: Ohh fun. Actually, backpacking off of that. You cook a lot at home now. Have you ever had, like, an incident where you've been cooking for a certain meal and you needed an ingredient, but you didn't have like accessibility to said ingredient.
Gracie Cabrales: Well, I sometimes don't go on a lot of the grocery store runs, so a lot of times Mom and Dad will forget like mushrooms or we won't have enough meat. So either A. we just go back to the store. Or B. we just do without it. Like I remember one time I had only one sauce of like the regular tomato and basil. And the only other sauce we had was like this pizza sauce. And I was like, well, **** it. I don't care. So I just put that in there and it didn't turn out horrible. It wasn't the original, but it wasn't bad. So I was just like: “OK, this is cool.”
Gabriella Cabrales: Do you think substituting certain ingredients can kind of shift the culture around the dish or the meaning, like, behind the dish?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah, I think it could give it like a different sort of character. I remember, like when I did it, I don't know if it was mom or dad, but they noticed that it was different and they were like: “Oh, what the heck?” Like, “Why is this --?”
Gabriella Cabrales: Right.
Gracie Cabrales: Like, “why is this?” Yeah. So, it I don't know of any like culture would be connected to it, but there's definitely a change that everyone in the family can tell when they like, eat it so.
Gabriella Cabrales: Do you think you make cultural foods, or do you think the foods you make have no connection to culture?
Gracie Cabrales: To my culture? Probably not. Like I want to say the one time you, me and Xotchil made tamales was probably the most I've ever gotten.
Gabriella Cabrales: Well, I also wanted to piggyback off of that. For some context, we are a family from Mexican immigrants and a lot of our family is from New Mexico, whereas Gracie and I are from North Texas and we visit them regularly, but they tend to be more in tune with their culture than I would say we are. Do you think that sort of difference between where we grow up and where the rest of our family grew up has a connection to our food and, like, the culture surrounding our food; the relationship with our food, do you think there’s a difference?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah, I mean. I'm sure Grandpa ain’t eating Whataburger all day every day, like I want to say, Fresa and Teresita [our cousins] -- They've well, they used to work at that restaurant, right?
Gabriella Cabrales: Right.
Gracie Cabrales: So, I mean, their life was all around that making -- You know, I don't know. What did they make? They made like --
Gabriella Cabrales: Well, I don't think they cooked, I think. They were just runners.
Gracie Cabrales: Really?
Gabriella Cabrales: Yeah. 
Gracie Cabrales: I swear I saw one of them in the kitchen. 
Gabriella Cabrales: I don't know. 
Gracie Cabrales: Well, I know they're around more stuff than we are, so they probably know more about, like, fajitas and tacos and stuff like that. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Are you envious of our cousins in that sense?
Gracie Cabrales: A little bit, yeah. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Are you --? Excuse me, I’m trying to think exactly how I want to word this question. Are you envious? For example, of our cousins making homemade tamales or enchiladas and having homemade, like meals, are you envious of that? Do you wish you grew up with that?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah. Like I think it would have been cooler if we learned more about our culture instead of our dad just kind of adjusting to our mom fully, like, cause I know she didn't do any of that. So like, now we don't have much to say. UM, like for example, when in elementary school when they would ask us “what kind of traditions do you do?” like cultural traditions. And I didn't have anything to put on my paper. So yeah, I'd say I'm freaking envious.
Gabriella Cabrales: Do you think if you did grow up in that environment, it would have changed your -- well, less change and more inspired you to go the culinary route in a different way. Do you think it would have changed that aspect of your life?
Gracie Cabrales: Maybe. Maybe the reason I'm in culinary is because I'm not burnt out from it in like my earlier ages. I feel like there's only one or two people in my culinary class that actually have a lot of experience and cook a lot in the kitchen and everyone else is like, “well, I came to just get a skill from it” or like “I'm trying to learn more about it,” but, I feel like maybe it was a good thing that I didn't cook a lot at home because then I'm not thinking more of cooking, as of a chore than as like a hobby.
Gabriella Cabrales: It's very interesting. I like that. We're going to move on to your schooling. You are currently a culinary student at LaGrone Academy?
Gracie Cabrales: And DHS. Well, I was -- ok. Yeah, yeah. LaGrone. Because I only do food science at DHS right now.
Gabriella Cabrales: Now, but you used to do intro culinary classes at Denton High School, correct?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah.
Gabriella Cabrales: Tell me, are those cooking classes different? Those cooking classes at Denton High School, are they different from the cooking classes you take at LaGrone?
Gracie Cabrales: Yes, but that's only because of resources. Like, I feel like we have a bunch more resources at LaGrone than we do at DHS. Like, there's better machinery and they have more of a budget with food. So, we're always, always, always cooking something, but with DHS, the only, like, money source we have is from our little café that we have inside of a classroom. So, not everyone is able to see it. 
Gracie Cabrales: And Denton ISD has restricted us from being able to sell to children during school hours. So, we don't get as much money as we usually would if we were to sell during hours.
Gabriella Cabrales: Right. Could you tell us a little bit about -- So that was your experience at Denton High School?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah.
Gabriella Cabrales: Could you tell us a little bit about your experience specifically at LaGrone High School? I mean just LaGrone Academy. 
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah. So with LaGrone, I have met other chefs from like Escoffier and just other universities that they teach at so they'll do like a -- they'll make a dish for us, like the last person. He made these like orange chicken fajitas or something, just asked us a bunch of questions while he did a demo for us. And they also have their very own Bistro. So, some days you'll get picked to go work Bistro and you'll work like the coffee machine or the cash register, or you'll run the lines so you'll be making like burgers or hot dogs, but I think it's a lot more hands on than it would be at DHS.
Gabriella Cabrales: For LaGrone, you said there's a Bistro. Was there also a food truck or just a Bistro? 
Gracie Cabrales: Yes, there was a food truck, which I did. I am in the food truck. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Is that the competition that you did?
Gracie Cabrales: No. That’s just, like, a food truck club.
Gabriella Cabrales: OK, tell me about your food truck experience.
Gracie Cabrales: My food truck experience -- so that, you can earn a cord for and basically you go around in this little cute food truck that LaGrone had engineered themselves. So, they had their little engineering group and their mechanics and welding and stuff build that for the culinary people. And they book a bunch of events around, mostly at elementary schools, which I had the opportunity to go and go to my old elementary school, McNair Elementary, and serve to little kids there. And I saw some of my old teachers there.
Gabriella Cabrales: I didn’t know that!
Gracie Cabrales: I didn't tell you that?
Gabriella Cabrales: When were you gonna tell me that? 
Gracie Cabrales: I don't know. I thought I told you that. Well, yeah, I went back there, and I saw like, one or two teachers. And actually, one of the LaGrone students there was in McNair too. And so, I guess I reconnected with him because I didn't realize that he went to McNair until I asked him, and then I looked up in my yearbook and there he was. And I was like, “Oh my God.”
Gabriella Cabrales: Interesting. 
Gracie Cabrales: I know. Yeah.
Gabriella Cabrales: Can you tell me the differences between working in the bistro versus working in the food truck?
Gracie Cabrales: Oh, I have a lot more accessibility to items at Bistro. Like our sink in the food truck doesn't really work. Like, it only spits out cold water, which is not what you want. But you know at the Bistro there's like two or three of them. And space is a lot more limited in the food truck than it is at Bistro, so you're constantly, like, shoved up against each other. Let me think it's a lot hotter in the food trunk than it is in Bistro because there's not good air conditioning as there is on the inside of the building. And it's louder because of the engine and stuff that keeps stuff going. So you can't. You're going have to, like, scream compared to the bistro. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Would you say the food truck environment is more fast-paced or do you think they have the same level of pacing?
Gracie Cabrales: Hmm. No, I mean for my experience, I'm sure other people have probably have different opinions, but for mine it's the same thing. It just feels more overwhelming because of how loud it is. So you know, everyone's just kind of moving around and you're like, yelling out orders and stuff and fixing it up and you're just trying to be as fast as you can.
Gabriella Cabrales: How do you organize the orders?
Gracie Cabrales: So, for Bistro you just shout. Legit, the person at the cash register will be like” I need a Gatorade” or “I need a hot dog,” but when it comes to the coffee, they'll have someone write down their order and send it to the coffee machine. And they'll have that fixed up. Now, when it comes to the food truck, everything is on a piece of paper. So, last time we were serving nachos and someone would write down the person's order, send it up through the window, and they'd look at it and we'd have, like, this kind of buffet line. It was like chips, cheese, beef and like chicken and stuff. And so, you'd read out the order and it would be like, “I need one with cheese and chicken,” and then like, “sour cream, no tomatoes,” but yeah. It’s honestly kind of like, what’s it called? That one cool math game, Papas Pizzeria or something. It's like that. That's like the same setup really.
Gabriella Cabrales: OK, do y'all have different --? I know you said in the Bistro, there's different jobs based on like, working the register versus cooking. Do you have different jobs same [system] in the food truck?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah, you've got again people working the register, people working the actual food. And then I don't know, sometimes we have like cookies and drinks out there. So, they'll be doing that too.
Gabriella Cabrales: For specifically the cooking part, is there a person that does like meat and then a person that does toppings? Or is it just like one person that cooks? 
Gracie Cabrales: No. Yeah, it's -- 
Gabriella Cabrales: Well, what are those positions? 
Gracie Cabrales: Last time in the food truck it was one person on chips because you have to measure out the amount of chips so everyone gets the same amount. Then one person on cheese, beef and chicken, which was me. So, they'd have to call out ‘cheese and beef” or “cheese and chicken”. So, then I'd just do that obviously, and then I'd send it off to the toppings person and they would look at the paper and be like, “Oh. I need cilantro, tomatoes and onions, but no sour cream, no olives.”
Gabriella Cabrales: OK, that's very interesting. Uhm, on to the more like classroom part of your academy. So, you've worked the food truck and you've worked the Bistro and then there's also just regular cooking in the classroom, correct?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah.
Gabriella Cabrales: For that cooking in the classroom, do they just teach you foods and then you make them? Or how does that system work? 
Gracie Cabrales: No. So actually, we're going around the world and we'll learn a bit in the first part of class because, it’s like a two-hour class, or maybe two and a half. It’s a long class, so for the first part, we’ll go over [countries] like the Philippines or Germany, or just different parts of the world, and we'll kind of talk about it. Then she'll give us all a recipe that's based on each country, and she'll talk to us about what we need to do and like -- tweaking the recipe because we may not have like fish sauce or lemon juice, so we'll have to just substitute it out. And then, they're pretty easy recipes, so you just follow the recipe. We don't really get a demonstration. Sometimes she’ll do a demonstration, but it’s pretty easy to just figure it out on your own.
Gabriella Cabrales: In your intro classes back at DHS, did they ever do like, demonstrations, or was it kind of the same concept?
Gracie Cabrales: I think they did, well, because It's not an advanced class, so they would always do a demonstration, one class, and then you'd do it yourself the other class. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Okay. 
Gracie Cabrales: So that [class] they're more so holding your hand and the advanced one, you just kind of read it off and then you're like “Okay.” 
Gabriella Cabrales: Did it become more advanced when you got to LaGrone or did you take advanced classes while at Denton High School as well?
Gracie Cabrales: No, I took it because -- I had three culinary classes. I had intro culinary one, which was -- it felt like they were holding your hand the whole time. Then I had culinary one, which, that one sometimes they would demonstrate. Then you'd do it. Then other times they would just be like, “OK, I need you to do this” and you'd read it out and you'd complete your mission plots and then you get to work and then at LaGrone, we like, I want to say did like two or three demos the whole entire year and then the rest you just did yourself.
Gabriella Cabrales: Were there any certifications you needed to get in order to start working in the bistro or the food truck, or even the classroom? 
Gracie Cabrales: Well, for my advanced class I needed to get my manager certification, which is what I did my junior year for culinary one. And in order to get my managers [certification], I had to get my sanitation license. Which is what I did for intro.
Gabriella Cabrales: So how do you get your sanitation license?
Gracie Cabrales: Um. That one -- It's on serve safe and you have to watch a bunch of long videos in -- Oh my God, it's literally common sense. “Don't pick your nose and then serve someone food” and like, “don't leave chicken out.” Like that's literally it. It's really simple to get it, I honestly don't know how people fail that but, It's on serve safe like.
Gabriella Cabrales: Right.
Gracie Cabrales: If you go to like any restaurant ever, they'll have it on their, like, wall and it'll be like “serve safe sanitation license” blah blah. I've looked at so many restaurants and they all have it.
Gabriella Cabrales: Okay. And what does it take to get your manager’s certificate?
Gracie Cabrales: Again, it's also on serve safe. That one's a little harder, and it crams, like, a lot more in it, but that one I like barely passed. I'm not gonna lie, but I've gotten better, trust. But, that one we had to work more with the textbook and stuff. But we got it done pretty fast and only took us like two months.
Gabriella Cabrales: What do you have to know to be able to get it?
Gracie Cabrales: Well, we've got to know basic stuff in the kitchen like: How to tell when to send something back when you get deliveries. Like, if your box is looking a little smooshed or wet. How to temp your beef and chicken and stuff so it's not served raw. How to [talk] about different pathogens and all those good viruses. What's another one? We learned about cutting fish and chicken and stuff so that we don’t leave physical contaminations in our food. Oh, and that was another thing. You know, physical, chemical and -- oh shoot, what was the third one? Uh. Biological, I think, contaminations. Those three, so -- But yeah, we just based that a lot and we read the textbooks and did these paperwork sheets.
Gabriella Cabrales: Did you have to or have you had, in any of your classes, to learn this science behind the food like lipids or proteins or stuff like that? Did you have to learn?
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah, we had to learn about all that stuff. Like, what's that triangle thingy? 
Gabriella Cabrales: Oh, like the food pyramid? 
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah, we had to learn the food pyramid. And you know, our proteins and vegetables. And like, OH! We had to learn our -- what’s it called? The eight allergens. Like, the milk and the eggs and the fish and the peanut and stuff like that.
Gabriella Cabrales: Oh, OK, interesting. And in the classroom, we talked about earlier, you learned how to make something, and then you made it, or you just followed a recipe. Uh, what has been your favorite dish to make in the classroom? Any class, any school which was your favorite and why?
Gracie Cabrales: There was this one thing we made. I think it was lobster rolls. Which is famous more in, like, the, I don’t even know, Northeast area. Like, where New York is or something over there. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Okay.
Gracie Cabrales: Because of all the, you know, the seafood, but it was really good, like the bun that we made for it. It was kind of like, I want to say a hot dog bun, sort of. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Oh, I know what you're talking about.
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah. And then it had, like some lobster -- or not lobster -- [it had] crab in it. The only thing that made me sad is that it was like imitation crabs. It was not nearly as good as it would have been if it was real crab. I really enjoyed that. I don't know why I remember that, because I kind of feel like I didn't like it that much, but I really like the bun, like a lot.
Gabriella Cabrales: Right.
Gracie Cabrales: And then this year, we made tres leches. That was so good. I didn't realize that it was like these little soaked ladyfingers and coffee, and it tasted so. It tastes exactly like coffee is. It was delicious. I loved it.
Gabriella Cabrales: Okay and then same question but for your least favorite dish [to make].
Gracie Cabrales: Let me think, let me think. Ah. Probably just like. Basic sugar cookies. Just because it gets really boring and it's a lot of measuring because you've got to be precise when it comes to baking. UM, or else it's going to get messed up, but I don't know. I like doing a bunch of different things with it or also anything that has to do with cutting tomatoes. I hate cutting tomatoes so much. In general, just cutting any like vegetable because I'm not good with the knife. So, it's just like it really makes me humble.
Gabriella Cabrales: Oh, my goodness. Is there any sort of? I don't want to say specialty, but is there any specific category you want to kind of go more into? Like, cooking versus baking or chocolatier or meat? Is there any specific area you want to specialize in, or no?
Gracie Cabrales: Honestly, when I was in competition, I really enjoyed making sauces, like, I don't even know why. I just liked being like, “I wonder if these two will be good together” and then finding out because I made some pretty good sauces. Like, to the point where these people were eating my sauce by itself.
Gabriella Cabrales: Interesting
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah, I honestly really liked making sauces. It wasn't, but I felt kind of weird because everyone else seemed to think that sauces, like, really sucked and they hated it. So, I was just like, “we're supposed to hate sauces?” Like, what the heck? But I also like watching people make chocolate. Like, I think in my intro to culinary class you would pour chocolate straight on the table and like, make it kind of flat and stuff. Then you go outside and let it dry. And you peel it from the things, so you have, like, these chocolate pieces and it was really fun.
Gabriella Cabrales: You mention your competition, can you tell me a little more about that entire experience? 
Gracie Cabrales: Ohh yes. That was so fun because since I'm trying to get into hospitality management, we got to do a tour at this hotel. Sorry I don't remember the name of it, but we got to actually go in depth with it and go downstairs to like their hallways and how they move around, and stuff. We got to go in their kitchen and look at their supplies and stuff. And they had a bunch of these really fancy pans and pots and stuff. Oh, my goodness, you should have seen their fridge and look so organized and colorful. I loved it and they let us go in the laundry mat area and then we went on this, like, balcony and it was really pretty. I met the manager of the place too, so that was really cool. And then the actual competition was really fun. It was like the Escoffier, like, chefs’ competition. And there were a lot of teams there. It was really scary.
Gabriella Cabrales: Where was the competition? 
Gracie Cabrales: Like the actual place? 
Gabriella Cabrales: Yeah. 
Gracie Cabrales: It was in Austin, TX, 
Gabriella Cabrales: OK. And then how did the competition go down? Like, what was the bracket system like? What did y’all make?
Gracie Cabrales: Well, since there were so many teams, they had it in three heats. So, I want to say like 40 teams went each time and it was kind of cramped, like I'm not going to lie, but every team had their own small table and you basically had to follow sanitation rules. Which is, like, constantly wearing gloves, constantly washing your hands, constantly wiping down the table and then safety rules where you're always constantly talking to your team. Saying stuff like “I have a knife” when you're walking around or “behind” so you don't run into someone, and you know saying other calls like “hot pan.” But, you know, you constantly have to be thinking about what you're doing, and you can't cross contaminate. So like, if you're cutting, you know, chicken on the board, you can't just go and put broccoli on it because you'll get points taken off. UM, but the ingredients that they gave us [were] Coca-Cola, a fish paste, blue cheese and then this other really salty, brown thing. I never figured out what it was, but they also gave us some other stuff that we could have used [even though] it wasn't mandatory. So, I don't know all these vegetables and like rice and stuff, but it gets really stressful in there and they counted off some sanitary stuff for us. I think we did really good on that. We ended up making a Coca-Cola chicken with some rice and kind of, like a fish sauce. Oh, and um -- what’s those small, little vegetables called?  Uhm. I don’t remember. I’m sorry. 
Gabriella Cabrales: That’s alright.
Gracie Cabrales: Brussels sprouts! Brussels sprouts.
Gabriella Cabrales: Brussel sprouts! And then was that experience stressful for you? Was it fun for you? Did it make you want to continue going into culinary? How was like, how was the experience? 
Gracie Cabrales: I will say that it was stressful in the beginning, but overall, the whole trip I would for real do it again because it was really fun and it honestly did make me realize that, you know, I wanted to do more of it because after we were done, I was like, “oh, shoot, no more practice like and no more stuff like that.” So, I think I liked the opportunity of just being given a bunch of random stuff and like challenging myself as to what I knew about making myself. It was also kind of, like, a good realization of how little I actually knew on how to make stuff just like by giving these certain ingredients.
Gabriella Cabrales: And now I have a question [about] what your plans are for the future.
Gracie Cabrales: I know that I am going into hospitality management. Now, I haven’t fully decided on what kind of branch I would into, but I'm kind of open to, like, helping with resorts or popular hotels, or maybe even a cruise, but I I'm liking the fact that if I get a good enough opportunity, I might be able to travel the world and help other hotels or businesses from other countries.
Gabriella Cabrales: OK. So that's something that you would be interested in doing. 
Gracie Cabrales: Yeah. 
Gabriella Cabrales: Okay. And then I had a question on -- How do you imagine the world of culinary arts being in the future?
Gracie Cabrales: Uhm. I think that there [will] be a lot more dishes created. Like, I'm sure 20 years before if you were to be optimistic about -- no, let me reword that. I feel like, if you were to show someone a recipe about like Coca-Cola chicken, they'd be like “what the freak are you on?” But you know, now we have stuff like that, where they'll just basically do anything. Like how chains will mix stuff up. For example, Whataburger and their Dr Pepper milkshake. I think it could literally go anywhere, really. But since there's so many people just cooking and stuff on apps and sharing it [on] like TikTok, Instagram, or Tasty. There's just a bunch of stuff people are creating every day.
Gabriella Cabrales: Great. And then one final question. How do you imagine the future of accessibility being in North Texas?
Gracie Cabrales: I think that is also growing because just by the three years that I was in a culinary classroom, I already saw improvement with each school. And just like accessibility to a bunch of resources like my teachers and the equipment and food and stuff. Also, hands on work like the food trucks and the Bistro. So, I think it's improving thoroughly.
Gabriella Cabrales: Wonderful. Well, that's all the questions I have for you. Thank you for telling me about your culinary schooling experience and allowing UNT to learn more about what new culinary students are doing these days.
Gracie Cabrales: Yes, go mean green guys.
Gabriella Cabrales: Go mean green. Alright. Well, I hope you have a great rest of your day.
Gracie Cabrales: Thank you. You too.
