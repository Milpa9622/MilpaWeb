Leslie Luna: Okay, I am taking a history of Latin American 
food course, and they wanted us to interview 
somebody that has some experience in the culinary 
arts and in particular there is going to be some 
questions about your background. Obviously, I 
know a little bit of information about some of 
your businesses. So, I would like to ask some of 
those questions from there. Okay, I will go ahead 
and start. Do you mind telling me your full name 
please?
Cindy Lucio: Cindy Lucio.
Leslie Luna: Okay. What was your date of birth, and can you 
tell me a little bit about where you grew up?
Cindy Lucio: October 16, 1962. I was born in Dallas, grew 
up just South of Dallas, and then when I 
graduated from high school, I met my now husband 
and we started dating and it was very interesting. 
I'll bring up some points that have to do with 
what you're studying. So, the place where I grew 
up was a very white suburb of Dallas. We had 
basically two Hispanic families in the high 
school and maybe two black families in the high 
school as well. Otherwise, everybody else was 
just white. So not diverse at all, but it was a 
great public education because at the time there 
just weren't issues that we have today. But, 
anyway, so Javier and I met, and we started going 
out, and when I went over to his parents' house, 
I had always grown up in Dallas, and my family 
was from San Antonio, so I had definitely been 
around the Hispanic population and the food and 
the culture from an outsider. Later it's very 
different once you kind of enter into this home 
that Spanish is spoken, the food is only Mexican 
food. And I mean the house, you know, the home is 
the same. It was in the neighborhood right down 
the street from where I grew up, and we went to 
the same schools. My husband was actually born in 
San Antonio, but both his parents are from Mexico, 
so his mom does not speak English. And so, you 
know, I show up and she's only speaking Spanish. 
Well, luckily, I had four years of Spanish at 
that point, and I can speak enough or understand 
enough and then she understood enough English, so 
we learned how to have a two-way, two language 
conversation. So, I understood enough Spanish so 
she would speak Spanish, and then I would speak 
English and we could answer back and forth in our 
own language that we were more comfortable with. 
We had dinner that first time that I was over 
there and she stood in the kitchen and was making 
all the food and put it on the table, but never 
sat with us. She always was, you know, making 
sure everybody had their tortillas or if they 
wanted extras or anything. And I just kept asking 
Javier, when is she going to sit down? And he is 
like, she won't sit down until we are finished, 
and then she'll sit. You know, we were still at 
the table, but then she would sit down. And that 
went on for 20 years. And then finally, Javier's 
two sisters started helping. They did not help 
much. They, I think, were just not that 
interested in doing the daily things because 
their mom brought, you know, the culture of 
Mexico to the home, and the food, and everything 
else. And the girls at this point were like, I 
don't want that. I want to be more American. And 
I know this is a typical thing. So, when I was 
interested, because I've always liked to cook, 
when I was interested, I went up to her and I was 
like, how do you make this? How do you make this? 
And she was like, no, you don't need to help. I'm 
like, no, I want to know. I love to do this. So, 
she never had recipes. So, I started writing, of 
course I asked, but I started writing recipes and 
she only, you know, was speaking to me in Spanish. 
So, Javier's dad spoke English, so he was helping 
me. So, I wrote down her recipes for tamales, 
rice, and beans, and everything. So, when I 
finally tried them on my own, I was like okay, 
this just isn't working right. But, then I 
realized okay, you gotta do this in the molcajete. 
You gotta do this, you know, certain ways of 
doing things too, so I learned all of that over 
time. It was very interesting just the cultural 
differences. But, I think because I was so 
willing and wanting to know, and I think they saw 
that and helped me with it basically. So, that's 
kind of the beginning of all of this.
Luna: That is so awesome! I did not know that, okay.
Lucio: Yeah.
Luna: Yeah. Okay, well, another question that I have for 
you was a little bit more questions about Javier, 
let's see.
Lucio: Mhm.
Luna: Well, it was just some background questions. What 
would you describe that you do for a living was 
well as your partner, Javier? And then some of 
your hobbies and interests, passions?
Lucio: Okay, so currently, like, you know, we are leaving 
out about 50 years, but, you know.
Luna: Yeah.
Lucio: But currently, I do cook for other people because I 
sold the bed and breakfast I don't do breakfast 
hardly at all anymore. Javier has never been a 
breakfast eater. Well, he is. He eats cereal and 
yogurt, but that's it. So, on the weekends, I'm 
like, okay, are we going to have breakfast 
because I can make it or we can go out, you know, 
after church. Anyway, so I cook for people now, 
so if somebody is sick, or if there's a death in 
somebody's family, I will take food, and it's 
almost like a comforting thing right now is 
mostly what I find myself doing. So I catered an 
open house down at Sam Houston State two weeks 
ago, so I cooked all this stuff, pulled it down 
to Huntsville, which is almost to Houston, and we 
set up this wonderful little finger foods for an 
art auction that the graduate arts students were 
having, and they were all impressed because over 
the last few years they've had bought cookies and 
bought veggie trays. So, if my friend was the art 
teacher, is the art teacher, she was able to use 
the word chef, and then they let somebody, you 
know, because I have a commercial kitchen. They 
let me do that. Versus, you know, because 
university schools are very strict about, they 
have to be commercial kitchen or whatever. So, in 
all of the things she advertised chef Cindy Lucio. 
I was like, why did you do that? And, she said I 
had to in order for you to bring food that wasn't, 
you know, from the grocery store. So, that was -- 
that was interesting. And then just this last 
week I catered an event for about 50 people at 
Catholic Charities. They were opening a new 
program that they have, and they wanted a little 
open house, also finger foods. So, I did that, 
and I didn't charge them to do it. They just paid, 
reimbursed me for some food. So, you know when 
people are so grateful, and you've made a big 
difference otherwise again, they would have had 
to go buy veggie trays or whatever it is. And 
when you can have a curried chicken salad, 
sandwiches, and fresh hummus that I made and 
several other things, you know, they were just 
impressed. And it sets a good, what do you say? A 
good representation that this is nice, you know, 
kind of thing. So, anyway, then we've had 
unfortunately a lot of deaths of our friends 
lately, so I always take food because I know 
there's going to be family members over there. 
Set up a meal train because that's always 
comforting. You know that you can have some good 
food not just always fast food or whatever it is. 
So right now, I volunteer at a place in their 
kitchen.
Luna: Yeah.
Lucio: It's called Taste Project. Do you know of this? 
Luna: Oh, I've heard of that!
Lucio: Yeah. So, I volunteer over there in their kitchen. 
They help train people that want to work in 
restaurants, and it gives them not a culinary 
certificate, but almost. 
Luna: Okay. 
Lucio: It gives them some kind of certificate. And so, I 
help in the kitchen to get these kids like knife 
skills and stuff like that. So, that's what I'm 
doing with my cooking right now. And then I 
experiment. I cooked for, I made lunch for a 
friend who is going through cancer, and she goes 
for follow-ups over here not far from us. So, she 
always comes over here and we have a two -- or 
three-hour lunch and I've made all these fun 
things. So again, more of a comfort food kind of 
thing.
Luna: Yeah. Well, that's amazing.
Lucio: Yeah. So that's what I'm doing with mine right now. 
What did you ask about, Javier? Something else 
about Javier?
Luna: Just what he does for a living.
Lucio: Oh, that's right.
Luna: Yes, Ma'am. That was all.
Lucio: Alright, so Javier is an architect, and he does a 
lot of pro bono work. So, he designs churches, 
and he usually doesn't charge them for his time 
and helps them to get a church that's within 
their budget because a lot of these smaller towns 
don't have money. So, he just did one out in 
Comanche, which is about a two-hour drive from 
here. It's down by Stephenville, and it's a 
Hispanic community and they just they just 
couldn't come up with hardly any money. So, he 
put together this church, and it ended up being 
amazing because of all the travels we've done 
throughout Mexico. He wanted it to feel like that, 
but it wasn't going to be a 200-year-old building 
of stucco and all of the wonderful materials that 
they have available. So, he did it out of metal 
like a barn would be, so it was a little more 
affordable and then he added to the outside of 
that and put a big circle window over the altar. 
And, they were able to find this beautiful 
crucifix from some other church and pews that had 
been discarded by some other church and the 
parishioners refurbished them and everything. 
Anyway, the Bishop came out, of Fort Worth, and 
blessed it so that they could open this church. 
And everybody was just so impressed that they 
were able to do this on the budget but the 
interior mostly it just felt good. It was a light 
blue. It's a light pastel blue, and it has kind 
of a golden color to it and then it has some 
green. So, it's just not what you would find in a 
typical church in the US, you know. So it was 
nice, and all of the I'd say 95% of the 
parishioners are Hispanic. They were all like ohh, 
I love it. You used our colors, and you know, so 
that was fun. So, he does fire stations, and he 
does city halls and community centers. It's 
called small commercial, and he'll do homes and 
smaller business type things for people as well.
Luna: That's awesome. That's so interesting! Yeah. Okay, 
let's see. So now I wanted to ask a couple of 
questions about the bed and breakfast. So, a part 
of the classes too is talking about 
sustainability and things like that, like the 
professor is very keen on like locally sourced 
products and stuff like that so I just wanted to 
ask a little bit about your cooking at the bed 
and breakfast, where you purchased the produce, 
if it was locally sourced, and how you handled 
food waste, if you did anything like that. 
Because I remember a little bit about having like 
a compost bin and things like that! 
Lucio: Very good. Yeah. I was gonna say you could ask your 
mom about all this, too.
Luna: Yeah.
Lucio: Let's see. Okay, we got married, and right after 
undergraduate school, we both went to University 
of Texas Arlington, and then we moved to Boston, 
and we lived there for eight years. We both went 
to graduate School, and we had both of our boys 
up there. And Cambridge, Massachusetts, much like 
Vermont and California, are big into 
sustainability and composting and recycling, so 
before those kinds of things move their way down 
to Texas. They've been a staple of the way of 
life in the northern part of the US, especially 
the two coasts for a very long time. So, in 
Boston, and now this has been 29 years ago that 
we've moved back to Texas, let's say 38 years ago 
or 7 years ago, we were doing recycling and 
curbside recycling, and composting, and we lived 
in this cool old apartment that had a compost bin 
in the backyard. And then the guy that lived on 
the bottom floor, he was always, you know, taking 
care of it and turning it. Yes, we had rodents, 
but that wasn't the garden where there were kids 
playing or anything, and then I took care of the 
front lawn. And we had one of those push mowers; 
It's not electric, or gas, or anything, it's just 
a push mower and we had a big tree I remember 
saying, oh my goodness, we can't get any light 
here because it was so shady. So, I did all this 
research, and I did all this permaculture stuff 
using compost in our beds and everything. So, it 
was interesting because I learned a lot from that 
experience. But, my dad was a farmer from 
Illinois, and he taught me gardening as well at 
our house. So, I've got a background in it and 
then going to live in Boston just that was 
everyday life you composted everything, you 
recycled everything, you didn't have waste. And 
then... When I went to Africa and you see there 
is no extra water. So how they, a lot of people 
deal is, they have a tub, a bathtub and probably 
four or five people take a bath in that water and 
then --
Luna: Wow!
Lucio: The water stays in the tub, and they put it in big 
five gallon buckets that never will go down the 
drain and they use it. Then they fill the back of 
the toilet so that little lid on the back of the 
toilet is not there. They're always filling that 
water so that you can flush the toilet. Like you 
know, it's like wastewater. So, then they also 
had buckets just piled up around to water their 
garden because they had to be as self-sustainable 
as possible. So anyway, after that experience, I 
came back and I was like, we are never throwing 
water out. So, it's a matter of like brushing 
your teeth. You turn on the water, but you turn 
it back off. You don't run the water for 10 
minutes before you get in to take a shower, you 
know. Washing dishes in the sink they don't have 
to be rinsed off, they can just be scraped off 
and put in the dishwasher. So, it's all this kind 
of composting and preserving and all of that that 
I have a background in and I think about those 
things. It's not like, oh yeah, I should do this! 
That's just part of my daily life and our kids as 
well. So uh, when I had the bed and breakfast, I 
was composting and taking it home and my, it was 
just so much compost! I couldn't keep up with it! 
And it's not like we threw a lot of food away, 
people did eat their food, but you have egg 
shells, and you have the tops of carrots, or 
whatever it is. So, I found out about a company 
called cowboy compost and they were just getting 
started, and I asked if they could do commercial 
and they said no, they're only doing residential. 
Actually, they were only doing drop offs. They 
would give you a bucket and you had to drop it 
off. And then they started picking up residential, 
and I said, well, I'm like residential. So, 
people stay here it's not a big business. So, 
they did it for me. I was the first commercial 
account that they had. So, we grew to where we 
would need two of those big bins a week and then 
they give you dirt because they would compost it 
and turn into dirt and then they would give you 
dirt back based on how much you recycled or 
composted with them. So yeah, part of the routine 
at the bed and breakfast was to take the compost 
outside. We don't leave it in the kitchen. We had, 
you know, bin and bin, probably three or four 
bins after one meal, and we would go take those 
and dump those. As far as buying local produce, a 
lot of times, especially if we did special 
dinners, chef dinners, and graduation parties and 
all that kind of stuff. I would always go to the 
farmer's market and get fresh produce when I 
could. And because we did breakfast on Saturday 
morning, I couldn't always go to the farmers 
market, so I got some of the vendors' names and I 
would ask them to keep it for me. So, I would 
basically pre-order and they would hold it so 
that until I could get there after breakfast and 
then it would be for the next week. And then 
there's a company that I would have deliver food 
every once in a while. They're out of Dallas and 
it's Texas based, local based. And then there was 
a little place that did, gosh, what did they call 
it? Where? So in my neighborhood there's a little 
garden shop and they promote people to do gardens 
and to grow extra.
Lucio: Mhm. So, if I decide to grow extra potatoes, I can 
take those and sell them to this garden shop. And 
they had people. Why can't I think of the term? 
They had people that would, and I was one of them 
that would do produce box. Weekly I would go pick 
up a produce box and I wasn't always sure it was 
seasonal, but say that person took extra potatoes. 
So however, many people, let's say 10 people did 
this program they had, so they had 10 extra 
potatoes everybody got five. You know, they split 
it up. They would equal it out. So everybody, 
however many it worked out and somebody else grew 
extra carrots. Somebody else had lettuce. So, my 
box weekly would have different things, but then 
I would take it back to the bed and breakfast. 
I'm like, okay what are we having this week? You 
know, because it was local, and it was fresh. And 
then there's a company that I used to order these 
boxes from also out of Dallas and same exact 
thing. I never knew how much or well I knew about 
how much, but I didn't know what all I was 
getting. So sometimes it was squash, and I had to 
figure out okay how can I incorporate squash into 
my breakfast? That's how I started doing like a 
veggie hash. Because I would get a lot of squash 
during the fall and I would get lots of tomatoes, 
I always requested extra tomatoes, cilantro, and 
the stuff that we needed for our Saturday Mexican 
breakfast. Sunday, we needed lots of berries and 
apples and pears when those were in season to go 
with our waffles or whatever it is. They also did 
local meats, so I would get pork and turkey 
ground and make my chorizo out of that too. So, I 
did a lot of it. And then do you know about blue 
zones? 
Luna: Uhm, No ma'am. 
Lucio: So blue zones is a program here in Fort Worth that 
our mayor promoted. It's a nationwide thing and 
Fort Worth was, I don't know, like the second or 
third city to do it. It promotes healthy eating. 
It promotes if you're ever at certain grocery 
stores. If you park out further away, they call 
it blue zones parking, so that you get a little 
more exercise. You walk, you know, all the way 
into the grocery store. If you make just healthy 
habits of walking and all that. But, it also has 
to do with not having a saltshaker on the tables, 
and using, this is a weird one to me, they wanted 
us to use goat milk yogurt instead of cow's milk 
yogurt, which is more expensive. So, I did it for 
a little while, but it's kind of hard to find and 
we went through so much yogurt at the bed and 
breakfast. That didn't work out so well, but I 
did keep up my blue zone's status through 
teaching your employees to eat healthy and making 
sure your employees got a certain amount of steps, 
and just promoting, you know, healthy eating, 
healthy snacks, healthy workplace environment 
basically. And so as far as like my menu? Uh. It 
did change according to the season and according 
to like I said, what I would get in my farm box, 
that's what it was called Farm Box.
Luna: Oh, cool. I never knew of it. That's so awesome.
Lucio: Yep.
Luna: My professor was trying to find -- I think one of her 
goals was to build an onsite university garden 
where we build certain produce, so that leads 
into my next question because she, I forgot what 
part of Mexico she was from, but we talked a lot 
about milpas. Have you ever heard of the style of 
milpa?  
Lucio: Yep.
Luna: So, we learned about that a lot, and I was going to 
try to lead into all your travels in Mexico and 
see if you were able to experience the milpas way 
of cultivating produce and just some differences 
that you've noticed between how Mexico cultivates 
their produce versus maybe how the United States 
does that?
Lucio: I don't. Yeah, I don't have a lot of experience with 
that. I would love to. There is a guy I don't 
know if you know or if y'all have discussed... 
This guy I can look it up in just a second, but 
he is a chef up in New York and he was noticing... 
he has a background, I don't know if he's from 
Mexico, but maybe his parents are. And, he 
discovered that everybody was using the MASECA 
brand and he's like, there's gotta be something 
else, you know, there's gotta be something higher 
end. There's gotta be somebody making this, you 
know, because there is somebody in every field 
that you know is going to make some nicer organic 
or whatever it is. So, he started doing all this 
research well, it took him to Oaxaca, and he 
spent all this time in the corn fields because 
Oaxaca is where corn originated, they found the 
very first kernel in Oaxaca. So that's a big deal. 
You don't ask for flour tortillas in Oaxaca; 
they'll give them to you, but they just kind of 
like, really, we're king of corn around here, you 
know. So anyway, in their botanical garden, it is 
behind their museum of cultures you get a tour, 
and it talks about the trio, they call it 
something else. Of corn, now I'm blinking on the 
three plants. Corn, beans. And one more thing, 
that all grow together, and the nutrients enrich 
each other. Do you know the third thing?
Luna: Is it any Chili's?
Lucio: No. I'm gonna have to look it up and what they call 
it because they don't call it a trio. I don't 
think. Anyway, it's very interesting because 
you'll see it in. Let's see. I've got a Oaxaca 
magnet right here. See it? So, it's got the 
outline of the skull for Dia de los Muertos. It's 
got a little grasshopper because you know that's 
one of their big sources of protein. If they have 
no money, they're going to have the chapulines. 
It's got mezcal. It's got agave, and then it has 
some words. Mole, chapulines, tlayuda, chocolate, 
calenda, tejate but it has all these pictures of 
corn. So, corn is a huge deal. But it's called 
something I'll have to look it up.
Luna: It might be squash. I have some notes over that. 
Lucio: Ah, I think it is squash. They eat so many squash 
blossoms in their quesadillas. They have squash 
blossom soup. I think you are right.
Luna: Yeah. Yeah.
Lucio: I think you're right and did you find what it's 
called, the trio? Or do they just call it a trio?
Luna: No, I haven't. I don't think we took any notes over 
that.
Lucio: Okay. But yeah, I think that sounds right. So, they 
talk about growing those together, so you know 
how a lot of farmers do, squashes over here, and 
corn is here, and beans are here. They tend to 
grow them together. So like big fields of cotton 
in West TX every once in a while, we used to go 
that way when our kids were in college, and you'd 
see all of these sunflowers. That is beautiful! I 
didn't know they were cultivating sunflowers 
around here. Well, it's to put nutrients back 
into the ground so that cotton can keep growing 
because it pulls all of these nutrients. So, I 
think it's every three years or something, they 
will plant all these sunflowers to put that 
nutrient, whatever it is back in the ground. Yeah. 
So, I think that's what the corn, squash and 
beans are doing for each other when they plant 
them like that.
Luna: Yeah, that's awesome.
Lucio: So yeah, so this guy discovered an heirloom corn and 
the way that they do the Nixtamal and all of the 
stuff they do in Oaxaca and brought that 
knowledge back with him and coordinated efforts 
with the oaxacan people, and now he sells his 
brand of masa. Masienda. He created a company, 
and they sell it all over. They just got in. I 
just got an e-mail. They're now in Central Market 
and Whole Foods.
Luna: Oh, cool. Okay, let me, im going to write that down! 
Lucio: Masienda. It's a little more expensive, but it's not 
that much more expensive. Maseca is so cheap, so 
maybe a a small bag of maseca, the blue corn, 
maybe it's $3 and maybe this is 6$. You know? 
It's sure, it's twice as expensive, but it's $6, 
right?
Luna: Yeah.
Lucio: It's not outrageous. Anyway, so, I have red, white 
and blue corn masienda. And you get on their e-
mail list, and it's very interesting because they 
will give little bits of history every once in a 
while. And this guy was talking about, he wrote a 
book called Masa. And it's really good. It's a 
really good cookbook. It's not just a cookbook. 
It's talking about his story. That's why I know 
so much of his story. And, how he took this back 
to the most famous restaurants in New York. And 
they loved the Masa. They started all making 
their own tortillas out of Masienda and doing the 
whole process like they do it don't like their 
meals, they actually do the mix them well. They 
do everything there. So, I think there's been a 
resurgence. I know there's been a resurgence over 
the last more than 10 years of going back and 
paying attention to the ancestral recipes and way 
of cooking. So yes, I am very much into that and 
every time I go to Oaxaca I take one to two 
cooking classes and I've been doing this for ten 
years. I find different chefs. Sometimes I go 
back to the same chef and I'm like, okay, let's 
do something different. I take all my groups to 
do a cooking class. The chefs there that I select 
are always really good. They take the group to 
the Mercado. They point out all the different 
things, whether it's what we're buying or not. 
But you know, this is so and so she grows, let's 
say, spinach up in the mountains. And no, she 
wouldn't be in the mountains that would be below 
land. What do they bring down? Oh, they bring, 
hongos! They bring the mushrooms down from the 
mountains. They bring corn from not high in the 
mountains, but a little bit higher than the 
valley. So, as you drive on some of these trips, 
you'll see corn fields, and you'll see cotton 
fields, and you'll see the bean fields and the 
alfalfa. It's really clear. I mean, I don't 
always know what they are they'll point them out. 
But it's really clear that that is this person's 
land. These are not massive farms like they have 
in the US it's like, I don't know, it's like our 
property, the size of our property, where our 
house is. That's how big, you know, their land is. 
So, whatever they grow, they then take that into 
town and sell it at the Mercados. So very, very 
local, very fresh, and they'll do that on a daily 
basis and then they have pop-ups. So in in all 
the neighborhoods, so the people from the 
neighborhoods know that there's going to be a pop 
up on Friday or the pop up is Saturday or 
whatever day. And they're huge. They're huge pop-
ups. I don't even think that's the proper word. 
They call them the tianguis. 
Luna: Oh yes.
Lucio: Yeah. So like in the neighborhood where I usually 
stay it's on Friday. So, there's like one or two 
little clay ceramic artists. There's some resale 
clothes. There's just a couple of weird little 
things, but then there's like two blocks worth of 
produce. And that's one day a week. So, they have 
to take everything down, haul it away. Like why 
don't they just take their stuff into the 
Mercado? And my friend that lives there said it's 
because in the Mercado, you know, they have to 
pay and the tianguis they don't have to pay. This 
is just, the city you know, just gives them all 
this land to come to every Friday. They have to 
take their tent. They have to take their coolers 
or whatever. So, and the locals like that better 
than the mercados. But if it's Monday and you 
need fish, you're gonna go to the mercado. But if 
it's something you wait till Friday because you 
like this guy that has this fish, you're gonna 
wait, you know. So anyway, I love that. And when 
I go, I don't usually cook because I'm in a hotel 
or something. But this last time I was there for 
three weeks last month, and I was in an apartment 
and I had a kitchen. I was like, okay, I'm gonna 
cook this time. I'm gonna go to mercados, and I'm 
gonna cook. But it was 97° outside and no air 
conditioning. I was like I am not cooking!
Luna: Yeah!
Lucio: So, I did reheat, like, I would have leftovers, so I 
did reheat a few things at night. But yeah, so 
that's the other thing. It's really hot. And 
these people, they don't complain a lot of times 
they'll have their comal outside. Like most of 
the time, their comal is outside, you know. 
Propane gas and it's big. It's like their comal 
is, you know, huge and they're making tortillas 
all day long, you know, so. At the Mercado, 
sometimes there's a lady. I go and eat her 
breakfast and she's just making tortillas, and 
somebody just comes and picks them up. Somebody 
buys them or a restaurant comes and gets them. 
It's very different right from here. But anyways, 
always local, always local and in season produce 
too.
Luna: Yeah. Oh, cool. Do you go to other places in Mexico 
besides Oaxaca?
Lucio: So, Javier and I over 40 years have been traveling 
and we've been to 17 of the 32 states. 
Luna: Oh wow!
Lucio: But lately, like when I take people, everybody wants 
to go to Oaxaca because it's been on the best 
place to travel in the world for two years in a 
row, and so more people are finding out about it, 
it's becoming very popular and people that I've 
set up tours and we get access to some of these 
artisans, the weavers and the clay and the 
alebrije has that my guest can't get in access to 
these people. So I've put together these tours. 
So it just makes it an easier way to travel for 
people. And a lot of people want to go because 
it's the food capital and because of the art, but 
they may not speak Spanish. They're -- maybe 
think it's not safe. And I just tell them that, 
you know, this is one of the safest places in 
Mexico. My Spanish is good enough to get us by. 
And you'll feel safe and we get to do all these 
amazing things, you know, having to do with art 
and food and culture. And the people are very 
welcoming, and they don't always speak English. 
They even not, not all of them even speak Spanish. 
There are 16 indigenous tribes. Throughout Oaxaca 
and they're the ones coming in to sell their 
things, so they can't read, they can't write, and 
they don't even speak Spanish. So they're 
speaking mixed, what is the other like Zapotec. 
That's what most of them speak. Yeah. So, like, 
Jacobo, the artist that I have been setting up 
this tour, he never used to do tours. He started 
it with me. He speaks Zapotec and he purposely 
will speak Zapotec to his parents while we're 
doing the tour so that we get to hear it. Now, 
you would notice the difference, but people that 
don't speak Spanish will not notice a difference, 
right? But I noticed a difference and it's 
interesting because it's still Latin based so you 
can hear some of the words similar to Spanish or 
some of them similar even to some English words 
but yeah.
Luna: How cool. Ohh my goodness. Okay, let's see. I didn't 
know. I'm sorry. I didn't know that zoom had a 
time limit, so I only have I think a minute left.
Lucio: Ohh a minute. You know what you'd have to do? You 
have to create another link and we'll have to do 
it again. If you want to do more.
Luna: Really.
Lucio: Okay. Or if you want to just send me some questions.
Luna: Okay, let me see what else I had. Sorry, just one 
second. Oh, I was just gonna ask. Let's see. 
Hopefully we have enough time. I think we should. 
Did you notice or do you notice and during your 
travels in Mexico? Any like food scarcity, kind 
of like how you mentioned in Africa. There was 
certain ways that they had to be sustainable with 
water, with food. Do you notice that in Mexico as 
well because it's technically still considered 
like a third world country or developing country?
Lucio: In Oaxaca, in particular in Mexico City and in the 
other places that I've been because they're a 
little more touristy kind of places, I don't see 
it as much. They're having a huge, huge water 
shortage throughout Mexico, mostly Oaxaca and 
Mexico City. So that's a huge problem. They are 
delivering water to the hotels. In apartments, 
but not necessarily to residents. So, they're 
going without water delivery, meaning in their 
shower, in their systems, and then they have to 
also go get those big bottles of water for 
drinking water. So, that right now is a big 
problem. But I've heard stories that if people 
can't afford --
