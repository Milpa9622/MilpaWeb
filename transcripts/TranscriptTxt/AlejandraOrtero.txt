Interviewer: Ava Ramos				Date: May 7, 2024

Place of Interview: Denton, Texas


 
Ava Ramos: Okay, today is Tuesday, May 7th at 6:30 p.m. My 
name is Ava Ramos and I'm interviewing my friend 
and my roommate, Alejandra, if you want to go 
ahead and introduce yourself.
Alejandra Ortero: Hi my name is Alejandra Ortero, I am 22 
years old and I go to UNT, currently living in 
Denton, Texas. 
Ava Ramos: All right, yep that's where we live [laughs]. So 
Ale, tell me about -- who are you and where are 
you from?
Alejandra Ortero: Yeah, so, I am a senior now after these 
finals now I'm a senior now in college. And I am 
from Garland, Texas which I've lived almost my 
whole life. Garland is just very diverse, within 
minority culture. I know in high school like I 
would go to like, or like the minority was white 
people. And there was a lot of Asians, a lot of 
Mexicans, a lot of Black people and then I also 
lived a little bit in Pleasant Grove till I was 
about 4 or so. Which is also very predominantly 
Mexican and Black. And then I also spent a lot of 
time in East Dallas which also felt very, very 
Mexican, a lot of Hispanic culture was there too.
Ramos: Okay, yeah I knew you're from Garland. I knew that 
cause you went to the high school there, so can 
you tell me about your parents and then where are 
they from?
Ortero: Yeah! So my mom, my parents are both from Mexico, 
my mom is from San Luis Ciudad Valles, San Luis, 
which is in Mexico obviously. And then [coughs] 
sorry, my dad is from Zimapán Hidalgo, which is 
just about 6 hours, so it's about a 6 hour drive 
for both of those places. And yeah, it's, Valles 
-- Ciudad Valles is very hot, and it's funny 
because Zimapán is very cold, so whenever we 
drive up there it's, we always get it, allergies 
because it feels like the seasons are always 
changing for us so yeah.
Ramos: Yeah that's real, so how does food differ from your 
mom's culture -- and does she live in the hotter 
or the colder area?
Ortero: So my mom was in the hotter area. 
Ramos: The hotter area.
Ortero: Yeah.
Ramos: So yeah, how does that differ from like your mom in 
the hotter areas and then your dad in the colder 
area?
Ortero: Yeah so it's, it's funny because in the mornings 
and at night with my dad's hometown it's very 
cold, but during the afternoon it's very hot. 
Surprisingly, they both kind of lived the same 
way. And by that I mean by acquiring their food, 
but they both lived in this little part of Mexico 
which is called la Huasteca and it consists of 
three states which is San Luis, Hidalgo, and 
Veracruz. And obviously we all have every region 
has their own different taste, and food and stuff 
but what's, what was different I guess, what I 
noticed is like with Zimapán there was a lot of 
heavy foods containing a lot of flour, containing 
a lot of I don't know what, maybe dough, yeah I 
was gonna say like masa.
Ramos: Like heavy.
Ortero: Yeah it's very very heavy with dough and flour. 
Well as with my mom's side in Ciudad Valles in 
San Luis it's very light. It's more so stuffed 
with more meat rather than it being stuffed with 
dough.
Ramos: Okay I see. So how does their food differ in Mexico 
that they had versus here in the United States?
Ortero: It actually differs a lot. Over there everything 
tastes very authentic [laughs].
Ramos: [laughs]
Ortero: Not to, not to --
Ramos: Not to trash, but [laughs].
Ortero: But it just, it feels very fresh, and that's 
something that my dad will literally lay his life 
down on. Everything is just very fresh, 
everything is very locally sourced.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And it's also very, in the United States is very 
greasy.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: While as in Mexico it's very, it's greasy but it's 
like a natural grease in a way.
Ramos: Yeah, it's a little bit easier to digest. 
Ortero: Yeah, exactly so, so yeah that's like the big 
difference between Mexico and the United States. 
As well as just like the quality of the food is 
just also very different.
Ramos: Mmhm, yeah. So do you have any examples of dishes 
that you've had, like, dishes that were, like, in 
Mexico and then also the United States that 
you've noticed a difference in?
Ortero: Mmhm, so there's this very popular dish in Ciudad 
Valles, which is called zacahuil. I actually have 
it in the freezer right now [laughs].
Ramos: [laughs]
Ortero: And it's basically like -- what is it? It's kind of 
like garbanzo beans almost. Or just like, it's 
not garbanzo beans but it's the ones you use for 
pozole.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And it's like a lot of meat, and it's very spicy. 
And I've tried it both here and over there.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And obviously, thankfully there's like, there's 
very hardworking people who try to bring a, you 
know a taste from home to the United States.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: It just differs a lot because, just like, the 
amount of seasoning is sometimes not right.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: It's just like very little touches, that make it 
very different from --
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: From what I'm used to at least. And then also 
another example, at least from my dad's side is 
barbacoa. And, what's it called, it's -- I don't 
know what it's called, I'll just stick with 
barbacoa for now. And it's basically, like over 
here it feels very heavy with grease, and it also 
feels like a little bit overcooked in a way. 
While as over there it's very, it's homemade it's 
like, it's, a lot of the things that people say 
is that they, they kill the animal the day of.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And so that's what, I'm very used to the taste of 
that. So, yeah.
Ramos: Yeah, I do notice the taste difference when I have 
food that's like homemade, versus --
Ortero: Yes.
Ramos: From a restaurant or something. And so how, does the 
way that your family acquire food, how does that 
differ from when they were younger, when they 
were in Mexico, versus now like with them in the 
United States? 
Ortero: It's very different because both of my parents got 
their food from basically from their backyard or 
from their neighbors backyard. Starting with my 
dad, like my dad had a, had like his dad was a 
gardener slash farmer in a way. Growing up he, 
like, they had the stand where they sold elotes 
and that's a very popular snack yes within 
Mexican culture as you know.
Ramos: Yes.
Ortero: So they grew the corn from their own backyard, and 
also a lot of vegetables a lot of that. And then 
the meat would come from their neighbors.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: Their neighbors had like a barn, and they would 
raise and obviously kill like piggies and cows 
and stuff like that. And also, whenever he came 
over here to the United States he worked at a 
milk, milking farm --
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: I remember --
Ramos: Oh, I didn't know that.
Ortero: So yeah. So it was just all very local and stuff. 
And same for my mom, my mom, she, growing up, 
had, like, a farm.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And it was, we call it a guerta. Which is it's kind 
of like a farm --
Ramos: Yeah, mmhm.
Ortero: But it's like, it's very green. And then with -- 
they raised like cattle, they raised a lot of 
sheep and stuff, and they -- and my grandma she 
would, she would sell the cattle for money.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And then my mom she always told me growing up how 
she would just, she's very into fruits.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: So she told me the reason why is because growing up 
she would climb the trees, and the trees would 
provide a lot of mangoes, and a lot of oranges, 
and a lot of fruit. So it's funny because my dad 
was more so with vegetables, and my mom was more 
so with fruit. So, it differs now with them being 
here because it's all from a grocery store.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: You have to go into this air-conditioned place, and 
over there it's, there's also -- What's very 
famous there's, yes there's grocery stores, but 
there's also a lot of meat markets which are out 
in the open. And every time we go out there it's, 
you know where it's coming from, you know the 
person selling it is, it's coming from their 
backyard.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: Or it's coming from their neighbor's backyard, or 
their grandma's farm of whatever.
Ramos: Yeah, yeah.
Ortero: So, it's very, like locally sourced. And I guess 
what Americans would call, what is it, farm to 
table?
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: Produce, I guess. That's very common over there, 
and obviously was a lot more common when they 
were growing up. Rather than now which is you 
know everything comes from Walmart everything 
comes from California basically. 
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: So, yeah, that's how it differs, I guess.
Ramos: So since family was like a big, not family, food was 
a big part of your family, how did cooking, what 
world of cooking play into your family when you 
were younger?
Ortero: Yeah, so it's like obviously in Hispanic culture 
the woman always cooks and the man is always 
outside [laughs]. And, but it's obviously cooking 
came from a necessity as it always does. You have 
to feed yourself, you have to feed your kids, and 
you have to like feed your husband or whatever. 
So it came from a -- it started from a place of 
necessity but, it also came from a place of care, 
and love. My mom, she, she -- I remember every 
time she would put the food down and she would 
make, she would start serving food for herself 
and my dad would always be like "All right guys 
1, 2, 3," and we would all chant "Thank you Mom!" 
For the food because we just wanted to be very 
helpful, or not helpful, but like very 
validating.
Ramos: Sweet.
Ortero: Yeah, very sweet with her, just very thankful that 
she made us this food. And that, recently we had 
a talk and she told me that, like, that was what 
really kept her going, whenever she was 
struggling at least. Because, yeah! And it's 
just, she, like I always say, comes from a place 
of deep, deep care because she's a teacher, she 
works very long hours, so for her to just come 
home and not be able to rest cause she has hungry 
kids, and she has a hungry husband. It's, it's, I 
feel like that's a very caring language for her 
because it takes a lot for someone to do 
something like that for her family. And, yeah 
it's just it's it comes from a place of love, 
necessity, and care as well.
Ramos: That's so sweet, that was actually so cute. Okay, 
well I was just about to also ask, what are some 
of your earliest memories that show your love of 
cooking?
Ortero: So, before I decided I guess my path of life being 
media arts. My, my path of life that I chose when 
I was at least like 12 or so was cooking. I 
wanted to be a chef, and um, and so I don't know 
where I was going with that. Could you, sorry, 
could you ask the question again? [laughs]
Ramos: Yes, okay you're good, what are some of your 
earliest memories that show your love of cooking?
Ortero: Oh earliest memories yes.
Ramos: Thats okay! Thats okay.
Ortero: [laughs] So um, yeah like I said I was a culinary 
major before this. And this was, now I know, this 
was because, I because I always saw my mom giving 
us this food out of a place of love. I wanted to 
take that like, take that weight off her 
shoulders in a way. Even if it was something 
super small, even if it was something super minor 
I wanted to help her out. And I think when I was 
like around 8 or 10, I didn't really know how to 
cook. But! I wanted it -- in the way I wanted to 
be thankful to my parents and with that I make 
them breakfast in the morning. Without knowing 
how to cook I just put like little cookies, and 
like little coffee. And I would, like, surprise 
them while they were in bed, and I was like, "I 
made breakfast!" And I would always wake up 
because we always had breakfast at like 9:00 in 
the morning. I would always wake up at like 7:30 
in the morning, start making my quote unquote 
'breakfast' for them. And then put like a little 
flower because my dad always got my mom --
Ramos: Oh my go -- [gasp]. 
Ortero: [laughs] Yeah my dad always bought flowers for my 
mom, so like, I would just put like a little 
flower in there. And, and be like "Hi, like, I 
wanted to give y'all --" like you know "You don't 
have to get up because I made breakfast already." 
And then also whenever she would make lunch, or I 
guess brunch in a way. I would always just be 
with her, and look at her, and talk to her 
obviously. But it was always to see what she was 
doing, and I'm a very visual learner, so it was 
also a way to learn. And I didn't really want to 
tell her about that, so I was just trying to 
like, catch everything she was doing. And that 
way I can surprise her, and be like "Look I did 
this, I did this myself." So, yeah and also 
whenever I was younger one of my favorite dishes 
as a kid, as it is for a lot of kids, was hot 
dogs.
Ramos: Yeah, oh, I love this.
Ortero: Yeah [laughs]. So, I would buy a composition book 
during school. And I did that for my mom to teach 
me how to make recipes and I wrote them down. And 
I had like this existential crisis as a kid where 
I realized my grandma's going to die, my mom's 
going to die, everyone's going to die [laughs] 
and, and, and. So I need to preserve these like 
recipes of love --
Ramos: Oh my gosh.
Ortero: And of you know like the culture. And obviously I 
started with the most American thing ever, which 
is hot dogs. But that was like the very first 
dish I learned. And thats probably why I will 
always like be, very endeared towards hotdogs 
[giggles]. Because it was the first dish I 
learned how to make, and it was the first thing 
that I, um -- It was basically like one of the 
first things I learned how to do dinner wise.
Ramos: Like independently too --
Ortero: Yeah!
Ramos: Like thats a big moment.
Ortero: Exactly yeah, I just wanted to show my mom like 
"Hey, I can do this myself. And I can do this to 
help you out. And even as I grew older --
Ramos: [coughs]
Ortero: Um, I, I was always the one who would make dinner 
for the family to help my mom out because I knew 
she was tired. And since I'm older and I know how 
to make more food then I wanted to help her out, 
so yeah. 
Ramos: That's such a beautiful answer, that was so sweet.
Ortero: You -- [laughs]
Ramos: So -- what about your anything that has to do with 
food and the holidays? What was food like in the 
holidays for you? Or where did food come up?
Ortero: Oof, it always came up [laughs].
Ramos: [laughs]
Ortero: We don't really celebrate Thanksgiving the way 
Americans do. But we like, we always try to have 
people over. With people over this is what my mom 
always taught me, if you have people over, you 
have to have food. And so she would spend hours 
cooking and she would never ever ever make turkey 
because she said it was too dry and I thought it 
was dry too. So we would make rotisserie chicken 
[laughs].
Ramos: Real.
Ortero: It was the next best thing. And she would always 
make different recipes and try to learn different 
recipes. Not only to impress the family but also 
to be like "I made this, this is what I bring to 
the table." Literally.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And then, the most predominant thing that I 
remember in the holidays is Christmas. Christmas 
is my mom's birthday, the 25th. So we would always 
go to Mexico, and my godmother she would make a 
big big like food for us for the whole family. 
And, and it was just she loves cooking. She would 
never made it like a career though, but she loves 
cooking and that was in a way it was her way of 
also saying "I love you guys, here's some food." 
Like "Here's what you can stuff yourself with." 
So, and that was just always like a thing, 
however, around like 2008 or so, 2010. The Narcos 
came, really, really bad. There was a lot of 
slaughtering's, a lot of beheadings. And my 
family didn't, because they had like an 8 and a 
10-year-old kid, they didn't want to risk their 
lives so um -- So instead, we had Christmas in my 
grandma's house. All of the, my mom's relatives 
that lived in the Us, we all got together, and we 
made tamales from scratch. And that is just 
something I will never, ever, ever forget because 
we made so many that it lasted us until like 
February. And, which is great! Because we 
celebrate a holiday called dia de la Candelaria. 
While basically the story behind it is if you get 
the baby Jesus from the rosca de las reyes --
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: Then you have, you have to make the tamales, and 
you have to make a party. So what would good is 
we didn't have to make them from scratch because 
we already had them from scratch [laughs].
Ramos: [laughs]
Ortero: From Christmas. So yeah, but it was just a, it was 
just. We all pitched in like all the aunts, all 
the uncles, and my dad as well. Um, the husbands 
and the wives. They all pitched in and we all 
just had like this massive feast, and it was just 
like, I was there with my cousins, and my sister. 
And it was, it's just such a fond memory for me 
because it's like it's a place of unity. It's a 
holiday for the family, and they've always been 
for the family in my case and so having this 
first Christmas not being in Mexico is like. Was 
very special because it was just, I truly felt 
connected with the family. Like no one -- like 
people got mad, obviously, but no crazy family 
drama was happening. And it was, it was just 
really nice it just felt like really nice to be 
there with all of them.
Ramos: That's so sweet. Ok that was a perfect ending, we 
can do part two in a few.
Ortero: Yay!
Ramos: Yay!
Ortero: Sounds good.
Ramos: Let me -- [recording stops].
[recording starts]
Ramos: Ok, so going back to your parents, and your 
grandparents. Could you tell me about how your 
parents' childhood was when they were younger, 
and they were in Mexico?
Ortero: Yeah. So my, I'm going to start with my mom. My 
mom's dad, so my grandpa, he came to the US in 
the 20's maybe like, no sorry like the 30s I'll 
say, 1930. So man's lived, man saw the Great 
Depression. And so he would always send money, 
always, it was always $20 back to Mexico. Which 
is a lot of money back in the day, but that's 
what he would send to the family and then -- but 
my grandma, she realized it wasn't enough. So she 
got herself to work, and that's how she acquired 
the farm, and she was also a seamstress. So my 
mom always talks very fondly about her childhood, 
because she said in the earlier days before the 
the farm and before the other jobs. Sometimes 
they would have just like a little bit of meat, 
to like my grandma will have just a little bit of 
meat to like put in the food and she had six kids 
to feed. So she would make, she would always talk 
about this like potato soup where she would chop 
up a bunch of potatoes, because they were very 
fulfilling. And she would put very little meat, 
the very like leftover meat that they had. And 
that was like, they're, like that was their way 
of eating. And it was, they were poor but my mom 
said that she didn't feel poor because of how 
much she ate, and obviously potatoes were locally 
sourced from outside. And so, it was very, it was 
very like, how do you say it? What's the word? 
It's -- it was very fulfilling in her eyes. And 
my dad he grew up a lot more poorer than she did. 
So there were times that he would say that like 
he wouldn't eat, and there was times where like 
they couldn't afford to eat. So that was very 
unfortunate obviously, but when they did eat he 
would always say that like my grandma would make 
the best of it. She would always say, she would 
always say "We don't have food today but we will 
have food tomorrow." And so it was just a way to 
look forward to the next day because yeah being 
poor is not easy, and I learned that a lot 
through my dad. And so it's very hard obviously 
hearing your parents say that, but seeing how 
much they overcame because of it's, it's very 
motivational too. And then also because once he 
left to work here in the US he obviously he was 
illegal, so a lot of the jobs were very under the 
table. He's a citizen now, so --
Ramos: Disclaimer! [giggles]
Ortero: Disclaimer! [laughs] He's a citizen now, but a lot 
of his earlier jobs when he was here was very 
under the table. And he was like "I starved, but 
at least my family didn't." Because he would send 
that money to his family in Mexico. So it was, 
food played in a way where it was surviving, but 
it was also like "Hey I'd rather sacrifice myself 
because I'm young, and I can live, but you're 
older and your kids are younger so let me help 
you out." So yeah. 
Ramos: That was so sweet. What about for -- so your grandma 
had a farm when your mom was younger, yes? So 
what was your grandma's childhood like before she 
had her farm? 
Ortero: Yeah, she actually lived, the way San Luis is, is 
made is like, there were obviously before the 
roads ,and before the railroads happen the -- 
There was a lot of like mountains, and a lot of 
like, we call them Cerros. Which is just 
basically like, bigger than a hilltop, smaller 
than a mountain. And so my grandma she used to 
live at a lake on top of the Cerro, and this was 
before she met my grandpa because when she met my 
grandpa they moved over to Cuidad Valles. 
[coughs] And so, she grew up very, very, very 
poor, she was 18 in the 30s so that gives her 
what, like -- she was born, like, the 20s or the 
10s, 1910s. So yeah, the woman has lived a lot of 
years. But she lived during the time when family 
was made, like people would make kids to have 
employees. So she had like five brothers and 
sisters, and every single one of them was in 
charge of something, like something to do around 
the house. Her thing was to do the dishes, and, 
and to also feed the chickens. So she did have a 
farm growing up too.
Ramos: Oh, okay. 
Ortero: So the reason why she like bought the farm was 
because she was like "Well I know how to --"
Ramos: You know how to do it.
Ortero: Yeah, so she was like "I got this, I got this in 
the bag." And then her sister was in charge of 
making the clothes. And so it, it just she came 
from a place of poverty, but it's kind of like 
how my dad lived where it was like "We don't have 
food today but we'll have food tomorrow." And 
sometimes they would even kill the livestock 
beforehand just to have some food. So it was very 
tough, very tough for my grandma. But, but! She 
learned that to not make the same mistake, or not 
live that same way with her kids. Cause she grew 
up thinking, were poor, we're da da da da da. 
Whereas, she made her kids grow up with "Were 
okay, were fine, were not poor. We're not rich 
though! But were not poor." So yeah.
Ramos: That's perfect --! [audio cuts off] Okay. [claps] 
Part 2. Okay, okay so the next question is what 
is cooking for you?
Ortero: Cooking for me. Well as always it's a necessity 
[chuckles]. It's, I have to feed myself, one way 
or another. However, for me it's, I guess it's 
like the way I interpret it with my mom was the 
way I interpret it with myself. I know when we 
first moved in, I would always ask you "Hey do 
you want some food? Hey, do you want this?"
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: And that's like my way of saving like hey, let's 
bond, let's get closer.
Ramos: Yeah.
Ortero: So it's like a love language for me for sure. 
Because acts of service of course. And it's just, 
it's a way for me to say, at least in my opinion, 
it's a way for people to say, "I love you, I'm 
sorry" it's a way for people to communicate. 
Ramos: Yeah, yep. Because we Mexicans are not good at 
communicating [laughs].
Ortero: Mmhm, no. Like me and my mom would always get in a 
fight, and then she would just like make me food 
and I knew everything was okay. 
Ramos: Yep.
Ortero: Yeah and especially if it was my favorite food, oh 
I knew everything was definitely okay. So it was, 
it's just that, it's for me cooking is a way to 
express myself without using words. And it's the 
easiest way to express myself without using 
words. So yeah, it's, it's love it's care it's a 
love language.
Ramos: That's so sweet. So you wanted to attend culinary 
school, so what led you to that conclusion?
Ortero: Yeah, I as a very, very, young kid I -- I was 
always job hopping, career hopping in a way I was 
young I didn't really know what to do. At one 
point I wanted to be a masseuse, at first I 
wanted to be like a mermaid, and then I realized 
that wasn't possible [chuckles] So yeah, but I 
fixated on cooking because, of how much like, it 
brought, or how much joy it brought to my life. I 
would like come to visit my family in Mexico and, 
and my aunt would always be there with tacos on 
hand. She -- they would like stay up because we 
would get there very late, because we drove, and, 
and they would stay up very late and make food 
for us whenever we were like "Hey we're like an 
hour away, we're like 30 minutes away." And they 
would always do that for us, so I was like I want 
to give this piece of myself and my family to the 
world. And then, and that's how it led me to 
doing that in, in the end. And then, I guess in a 
way it's, I realized how much safety went to it, 
the whole like food handlers and stuff, and I was 
just like you know what, maybe it's not for me. 
So, but I did I did take some classes for it and 
it was I that's whenever I learned about the 
whole food safety and stuff. And, but it was it 
was just very fun to learn about cooking, and 
myself and I wanted to do it more so that's, that 
was the main interest of why I wanted to join.
Ramos: So, what are the elements that led you away from 
culinary school?
Ortero: It was the, obviously the whole safety stuff, and 
when you're cooking at home you're not very 
sanitary, because you're cooking for yourself, or 
you're cooking for three other people. So, it was 
that, but it was also just, you can feel the 
divide with people. There was a lot, obviously 
you have your very like rich kids who, you know 
they've, this has been like their whole thing 
and, and all this and that, and you can just feel 
that. And I didn't really, I didn't really like 
that, and I also I took a class in in high school 
too and a lot of people just didn't really care 
about it. And I was just like I don't want to do 
this if nobody cares about what they're doing. 
Obviously, culinary majors do care about -- this 
is just a high school class, so culinary majors 
do care about it but they're very, perfectionist. 
They're very, very like keep an eye out for 
detail which I am very much about that, but I 
also, because I do so much food at home I'm used 
to not having everything perfect. Because if it 
looks like, if it looks perfect you know that's 
just for, money. While as if it looks full and 
you have your whole plate being full, that means 
it's good. So, that's also another reason why I 
just it I felt like it didn't resonate with how I 
saw food. And I was just like I don't want to 
hate this in the long run, so it unfortunately 
did drew me away, but I still love doing it so in 
a way it kind of didn't, so yeah.
Ramos: Yeah, so in that divide you said that you felt that 
with a lot of the rich kids, did you feel a 
divide coming from like a different culture into 
American culinary school? What did that feel 
like?
Ortero: Yes, yes, God I think any minority can really like 
relate to that, just like feeling some sort of 
disconnect, with like American Anglo white kids. 
They have this sort of Americanized way of 
cooking, and it's very gourmet. It's very like, 
you know, it's very fancy schmancy while as with 
like Mexican people or Hispanic kids, excuse me, 
it's, it's very. I wouldn't say sloppy because 
we're not sloppy at all, but it's more so about 
the quality, or not the quality. The like, the 
end taste of the food, rather than the 
presentation of the food. And then just like, I 
mean also just like growing up in Pleasant Grove, 
and then going on to like Garland like it just 
you could really feel that shift, because I went 
from a Dallas Elementary School to Garland Middle 
School and it was just it the divide is just 
there, like it's just even though, yes I was with 
other minorities not being in ESL not being in in 
you know like all these Hispanic groups I felt 
like I was too. Like too disconnected from the 
Mexican groups, and too Mexican for the other 
groups, so I think that's, and that's a feeling 
something a lot of people can like relate to. 
Because, yeah like the way you grow up is not -- 
is very different from from American Kids.
Ramos: Yeah, I understand that difference, like definitely 
in the way that food is made. Because authentic 
food has like, there's a vibe to authentic food 
like that feeling it's filling. You know?
Ortero: Yeah, yes while like other food is just like, it's 
just there really.
Ramos: So as you said you've come you lived in Pleasant 
Grove in Garland, did you see any difference 
between like the commercial restaurants versus 
the small family business restaurants that are in 
those areas?
Ortero: Yes very much so, growing up the most fanciest 
restaurant that I knew of was Olive Garden 
[laughs]. We never set foot in Downtown Dallas 
ever, so like it was going to like a Tex-Mex 
Restaurant like on the border or like Phoenix, 
Phoenix's or Felix's or whatever it's just felt 
very like plastic. It didn't feel authentic, and 
it felt just like another order, just like 
another thing to do. While I was what I would go 
eat with the mom-and-pop shops at least, at least 
in East Dallas. It was, it was very you could 
tell that they had cooked it the day of, if not 
the day prior. Everything wasn't frozen, 
everything was very fresh, everything was just, 
everything was also very handled with love and 
care. And like, like we said like Hispanic food 
is very filling it's very like, you know, and so 
with like the tacos, the taco shops that I would 
go to they would always stuff it a lot. And to me 
that is a secret way of saying "I know you're 
hungry let me feed you" or "Let me give you your 
money's worth", so, so yeah so I just I feel like 
with commercial restaurants it just feels very 
like plasticky, and very like rubbery, and just 
like very tossed aside while as with mom-and-pop 
shops because, because their whole business is on 
the line their whole finances are on the line, 
it's just it feels more authentic, it feels more 
caring and loving.
Ramos: So, what do you believe are some of the reasons that 
people do enjoy cooking? Like especially for 
those mom-and-pop shops, because like yes that's 
how they make money, but why would anyone else 
who doesn't need that money want to cook?
Ortero: It's just a way to like broaden your, your horizons 
too. It's just like my best friend Zoe, she has a 
boyfriend, her boyfriend's from Louisiana and 
she's been learning a lot of Cajun food to like 
cook. And she, every time we get together she 
like always tells me how she's like she's never 
tasted food like this before, like this is good 
like white people food, she loves to say. And it, 
it just expanded her, her like flavor palette. 
And for me too just like learning another, like 
cultures way of cooking, and somehow also making 
it my own is just a way of, of just like 
expanding my horizons. And even like, like 
traveling with my eyes closed like I make some 
pasta and I close my eyes and I feel like I'm in 
Italy. So it's just a way to like, to just escape 
really, to, to feel like you know if you're 
having a bad day or whatever you can just, you 
know you can just make something that feels like 
home in your home. So yeah.
Ramos: Yeah, that's so sweet. So what would you say to 
people who really don't enjoy cooking like what 
advice would you give them?
Ortero: I would say you haven't tried enough of it really. 
Because starting out is never easy, starting out 
is probably the hardest part of cooking. But once 
you learn your groove, that's probably what I 
would say, learn your groove, learn your, your 
own flavor palette, like what you like. And then 
just go from there, I like for example for 
personal example I like a lot of garlic and so I 
tend to put a lot of garlic powder in my food, or 
like a little garlic tooth in my food. So, and 
that's how I've learned to like make my own food, 
or like let's say you don't like salt. You know? 
Not everything has to have salt, not everything 
has to have you know certain ingredient to it to 
make it worthwhile for your taste buds. So I 
would say to like learn what you like and learn 
how you enjoy making it. Sometimes I remember 
starting out, I would just, I would need like 
some kind of entertainment to be there so I was 
just watch like YouTube videos while I cooked. Or 
I would like listen to music to get myself in the 
rhythm of cooking, it's just all about motivation 
really so like motivate yourself, and just really 
like try. Because if you're not, if you just try 
once and then you give up it's like okay, so why 
are you doing this? Yeah, so yeah.
Ramos: That was such a good answer. Okay, so why if I could 
have interviewed someone who actually worked at 
like a Mexican restaurant or some other farmer or 
whatever why why was it a good idea for me to 
interview you?
Ortero: Um, I guess like I don't see food in a money-making 
way. I grew up seeing food as like a very, a 
center of unity, center of love, a center of 
language too. It's so, it's, it's like not to 
brag, not to, like, talk too much about myself. 
But like it's, it's different when you make 
something and get money out of it, rather than 
make something because you love it. And, and I 
can definitely say this as a server, because I 
could tell you all about how great serving is and 
whatever. But I've lived my bad experiences, I've 
lived a lot of bad experiences serving, so if you 
had like let's say you interview like a cook or 
something. A lot of them would have a lot more 
bad stories to tell. While I have only messed up 
in the kitchen like, you know, not very few 
times, but like if I've messed up I still learn 
how to fix it and eat it, because I'm the one 
eating it. So in a way that's, that's like, 
that's the difference between just like a regular 
civilian who eats versus a cook, a line cook, a 
sous chef, someone who actually went to school 
for that because they see it more in a logical 
way rather than a passionate like, like yeah 
passion, like centered way. So, yeah I think 
that's like the difference between the two.
Ramos: That was so good too, that was so good. Okay, and 
then lastly, this will be the last question. Why 
do you think food, why do you think food has 
remained so culturally sacred especially in 
Mexican culture for so long?
Ortero: Because it's a way to keep connected to your roots. 
Every single time I cook I think of my mom, every 
single time my mom cooks she thinks of her mom, 
every time my grandma cooks she thinks of her 
mom. It's just, it's a way to pass down something 
without having it be physical. It's something you 
keep in your heart, it's something you keep in 
your mind, and it's something that, like, you 
think of fondly, you know? Like you, like I 
think, I think of my mom and I think of all those 
times she was really tired, and I think of all 
those times that she didn't want to cook so we 
had like we had a fast food Fridays. And she was 
like "Every Friday we're going to eat some pizza, 
we're going to make something super American." 
And it was because she was tired, she was tired 
from the week, she was tired from school, she was 
tired from life. So it's, it's a generational 
thing to pass down, and it's also just like 
something that, it's like it's unspoken of but 
everyone does it. Like everyone knows how to cook 
because of someone, and without cooking I mean 
how are you going to really live? Like how are 
you going to feed yourself? How are you going to 
survive? It's a way of making survival a lot more 
emotional, and a lot more gratifying sort of. 
Because everything just comes from like, from 
someone else and you know because it comes from 
someone else it comes from someone before then, 
and it comes from someone before them. So I think 
that's why it makes it so special and it's so 
sacred within especially Mexican culture, because 
a lot of Mexicans will always brag about how good 
the food is, about how great the culture is. And 
really it also speaks about the culture. Without 
Mexican food you wouldn't know why we do what we 
do. Or you wouldn't know why your grandma does 
what she does, so it's just like an unspoken 
language of like what each of us -- it yeah it's 
an unspoken way to talk about your story about 
your history. About like anything it actually, 
because it dates back to like the Aztecs, to the 
Mayans, to the Incas to whatever. So yeah, I 
think that's what food represents within the 
culture. And I think that's how it's going to 
keep representing the culture.
Ramos: Okay, that was so good, thank you for your time, 
Ale.
Ortero: Thank you.
Ramos: And I will talk to you after this.
Ortero: Awesome sounds good, thank you.
Ramos: Thank you.
