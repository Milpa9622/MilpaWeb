Michaela McPhearson



Interviewer: Bee Adame               Date: April 30th, 2024

Location: Denton, Texas


 
Bee Adame: OK. This is Bee Adame interviewing Michaela 
McPherson for Latin American Food History on 
April 30th, 2024. We are in Denton, TX. What was 
your first experience working in the food 
industry?
Michaela McPherson: So, it was during 2020. I needed a job 
and I started working at my sister's latest 
kitchen job: Nature's Plate. And I was just a 
dishwasher, I didn't do much in the actual 
kitchen. Really just, washing dishes.
Bee Adame: Yeah.
Michaela McPherson: Which honestly wasn't that bad. I know 
that dishwashers in particular are very like 
looked down upon, but. You know, as a job it was 
-- easy. Wasn't the best money at the time, so I 
did have to quit, and then I later went back to 
that same job in a different position. But I did 
like it. Like it was entertaining, it was fun.
Bee Adame: Awesome. What food service job have you worked 
the longest?
Michaela McPherson: So I've only had the one and it was 
Nature's Plate.
Adame: MHM.
McPherson: I worked at it longest the second time because I 
worked there twice the first time as a dishwasher 
was only a few months because the pay wasn't -- 
yeah the first time as the dishwasher was only a 
few months because the pay wasn't quite enough to 
like keep up with rent. And the second time I was 
there for a year-ish. Yeah. I want to say about a 
year.
Adame: OK, so Natures Plate? What kind of place was it?
McPherson: So it wasn't, it was food service. But it wasn't 
an actual restaurant. We were a essentially like 
meal prep and delivery service. We did plant-
based vegan meals. We have, we would keep a stock 
of like premade meals up front. And we would 
deliver twice a week, so people would put in 
their orders ahead of time. We would like bulk 
prep all of the meals and then.
Adame: Mhm.
McPherson: We would have -- our deliveries were on 
Wednesday and Sunday, so Wednesday and Sunday we 
would do all of our fresh stuff that had to be 
made like that day, which was usually like any of 
the salads that we had and then we would portion 
out. UM. Like all of the. Like pre made meals, 
bag them up, send them out for delivery. We would 
also on those days restock our pre-made stuff 
that we would keep up at the front that people 
could just come in, grab, go. So that was the 
general like structure of it. And yeah, like I 
said, it was plant-based vegan, so all like very, 
very healthy organic. I remember, when I was 
working there, I was mostly eating Nature's Plate 
food. So I wasn't like officially vegan. I was 
readily accessible vegan. And. Yeah, it was 
really just a plant based vegan meal prep grab 
and go and delivery.
Adame: Cool. And what is your most recent food service job?
McPherson: My second tenure Natures Plate!
Adame: I feel like Barnes & Noble counts, though. You're 
handling food and drinks.         
McPherson: That's true.   
Adame: It's in the context of this interview. It definitely 
counts.
McPherson: OK. I would say like, Capital F Food service 
would still be that second tenure at Nature's 
Plate. Currently I would say loosely food 
service, although the government does say that 
it's food service, working at the Barnes and 
Noble Cafe, which I guess would actually make 
this my longest tenured food service. Where -- 
yeah, it's just café, so most of what we're doing 
is drinks and then like premade food, we don't 
make any. Of it, we just. Thaw it, serve it.
Adame: Yeah, bake some stuff.      
McPherson: Yeah. Yeah. Not -- not what I would say we made.
Adame: That's fair. What are some lessons you've learned 
working in the food industry?
McPherson: Oh. People kind of suck, uh. Food service and 
retail kind of go hand in hand with eachother I 
think. You kind of get people at both their best 
and their worst. Because, you know, there are 
plenty of people where even if you personally are 
having a pretty s*** day as you're like. Giving 
them the service, they'll be very understanding. 
They'll like still tip all that jazz. They'll 
still tell you, like, thank you, have a great 
day, even though I probably wasn't the nicest to 
them for no real reason other than I was having a 
s*** day. But you also have the people who, no 
matter how pleasant you are, how accommodating 
you are, they still either just do not care or 
they're actively trying to make your life harder 
and that, I think, is the main take away. From 
Nature's Plate, I learned a lot about general, 
like food safety, food handling. I think in my 
personal life a lot of transferable skills that I 
use, like in the kitchen at home, like how to 
like properly handle a knife, how to properly 
like cut vegetables, sauteing. All that jazz. 
But, overall definitely just people.
Adame: Yeah. Yep, that's, that's very fair. Has your 
relationship with food in your personal life 
changed from like before you worked a food 
Industry job to after?
McPherson: I definitely enjoy cooking a lot more. After 
working at Nature's Plate that second time 
because I've learned like how to effectively prep 
my food. Learned a bunch of new recipes, and 
since I'm still friends with the old managers, 
current owners, um they'll just give me the 
recipes to use so. Yeah, learning how to like, 
again, prep food and then like cooking it, having 
new recipes, things that I didn't necessarily 
have to go out and like search for because I'm 
very much a little creature of habit. So I like 
having things that I already know how to use and 
how to make was really helpful. With that, it has 
helped me make sure that I'm eating more a lot of 
times that I'm eating better because I don't just 
have to get like takeout or just like s***** 
pasta all the time. 
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: Because I knew how to cook before, but I didn't 
enjoy any of it. Whereas now I usually enjoy the 
process and I can also like make changes to 
recipes that I find because I know things to 
substitute, or I know things that I don't like. 
I'm like, I can just take this out and add this 
like equivalent-ish thing in. So a lot of my 
recipes that like they're base level kind of like 
exactly the same like they're all built off of 
very similar stuff and then they kind of change 
and branch out as they go.
Adame: Nice. What is your favorite dish or type of cuisine 
that you like to make for yourself?
McPherson: Ooh. I've got a -- I can't remember exactly what 
it's called, but it's a Korean, It's a spicy 
Korean dish and it uses like Szechuan peppers. 
And that was what helped me like build up my 
spice tolerance and it's not like hard to make. 
It can be annoying to like find all of the stuff 
I need for it, because I can really only go to 
like the Asian markets for a lot of it, because 
it's very specific stuff. Like rice syrup, dark 
soy, stuff like that. But it's, it's really good. 
It's really easy to make. It's also really easy 
to mess up, but I've never had it be bad even 
when I've messed it up, which is really nice. And 
also people don't usually steal it.
Adame: That's good.
McPherson: Yeah I can, I can take it to work. And 
generally, people leave it alone because you open 
it and you're like, oh. She smells spicy and she 
looks spicy.
Adame: 'Cause she is.
McPherson: 'Cause she is, yes. Yeah, I like that one a lot. 
Also, I make just a lot of like fried rice or 
fried noodles. They're not necessarily quick, but 
they are like pretty easy, especially because I 
bulk prep all of my stuff which is partly because 
I'm very lazy, and I would rather not cook every 
single night of the week. And because I'm used to 
bulk prepping with Nature -- from Nature's plate 
because everything we did was in bulk.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: It's just easier to do it that way.
Adame: This seems really useful. I'm horrible at meal 
prepping, so I definitely --
McPherson: I don't necessarily consider it meal prepping 
because I don't really plan out when I'm going to 
eat them. I just know that it's going to be good 
for a week and I'm either going to eat it in a 
few days or I'm not going to eat all of it.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: And I'm going to waste it some of this.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: It's -- I really do just consider it bulk 
prepping because I really only bulk prep the one 
thing. And I just eat it whenever I decide to, 
there's not much like -- planning involved 
besides the, this is what I'm going to make, this 
is. how much I'm going to make, this is how long 
it will last.
Adame: What was your favorite thing to eat at Nature's 
Plate? Or like a couple of favorite things maybe?
McPherson: Oof OK so. We had these chorizo tacos, and it 
wasn't. It obviously wasn't actual chorizo, it 
was made with seitan, which is a, like gluten 
meat replacement and I love seitan. It is so 
good. And we would sear. Yellow onion and some 
green and red Peppers and put that in. Like a. 
Flour tortilla.
Adame: MHM.
McPherson: With the chorizo and. Like a plant based sour 
cream. It was a cashew sour cream. So good, I've 
actually got a bag of seitan chorizo in my fridge 
because I was craving them. We had -- I would say 
I've got three favorites, and it would be the 
chorizo tacos. Which every single time we made 
them I would pretty much buy us out of our front 
stock. Which I don't know if the owners loved but 
like well, we know that they're getting eaten. We 
had a Ziti Bolognese that I really liked, didn't 
like making it. It was kind of a pain in the ***. 
It tastes amazing and I will be getting that 
recipe from my friend very soon because I've also 
been craving that one recently. And. There was a 
chili that we had and this is actually, the one 
I'm making next. And. We had, like a frito chili 
pie that yeah, we had some, like low sodium corn 
chips which were also really good. I would snack 
on those all the time. And a like a vegan Nacho 
cheese, which is the only vegan cheese that I've 
ever liked was the ones that we had at Nature's 
Plate. And we would just mix those in with the 
chili and it was amazing. I could eat that for 
every single meal, and I did frequently. Multiple 
times, this happened more than once.
Adame: That's valid. All right. What is a dish or cuisine 
you've always wanted to try?
McPherson: Umm. I don't know. Because I tend to just 
things. Yeah, like, yeah, whenever I'm craving 
something. Especially in Denton, there's usually 
a place to get it, or at least in Dallas, if I'm 
craving. Korean or Japanese, there's always K 
town in Carrollton.
Adame: True.
McPherson: We've got some decent, like Japanese places up 
here in Denton. Got some good Thai places. Uh. 
God, there's one particular Indian place up on 
like 380 that's really good. 280? One of those, I 
don't know the roads. So yeah, I don't really 
know. There's nothing I can think of that I 
haven't -- that I've looked at and been like I 
really want to try this and I haven't. I wouldn't 
say I'm like, adventurous by nature, but if I see 
it, I'm not going to be opposed to trying it.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: I -- Ooh, I really want to try Mongolian food 
because I haven't had, like, actual Mongolian 
food. And Mongolia is one of the places that I 
really want to go. So I would really like to try 
like actual Mongolian food not like Chinese 
restaurant Mongolian food.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: And I -- I would also like to try Italian food 
from Italy because I don't really like Italian 
American food. I think it's very bland. But I've 
generally heard good like better things about 
Italian food in Italy. I've also heard that it's 
not well spiced so.
Adame: Yeah, that's probably true.
McPherson: Probably, yeah. Yeah, Western Europe is not fond 
of their spices. Eastern and like southeastern 
Europe, like the Balkans, great food, great food. 
Greek? Love it. But yeah, I would like to try 
Italian food from Italy also, mostly just so I 
can compare it and see if I still think it's 
bland and boring?
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: But I think beyond like Italian or Italy Italian 
food and like Mongolian food, there's nothing 
that really like jumps out, is like, no I got to 
try this. 
Adame: All right. What -- kind of goes back to -- what are 
some lessons you've learned working in the food 
industry, but what frustrates you about food 
service?
McPherson: People, it's still people. Obviously. One of the 
other main things is how looked down upon it is 
and like I've certainly been, I won't say guilty 
of because there's a lot of like social shame 
that goes in with it. I didn't like telling 
people that I was a dishwasher even though it was 
like one of the only jobs I could have possibly 
found at the time. I was fine telling people like 
where I worked especially like the second time I 
was at Nature's Plate, it was a lot easier. It 
was like, yeah, I do a lot of the food prep and a 
lot of the cooking. And I think part of that was 
because it wasn't like an -- it wasn't a 
traditional restaurant job because there's, also 
like you know, line cooks and, um, cooks at like 
chain restaurants or franchises very much get 
looked down upon like it's not a lucrative job. 
It's one of those that, like you have to do. It's 
not really something that we think of as "people 
do this willingly." We think of it as they're 
stuck doing this. I think restaurant. jobs in 
general -- Um. People very much like look down on 
them, which I think is also part of why a lot of 
people are comfortable treating restaurant 
workers like absolute dog s***. Because, If 
you're young, people look at it as like, oh, it's 
a starter job. It's the one putting you through 
college, all that. But if you're like a capital A 
Adult. Who's -- who either didn't go to college 
or is out of college still working your 
restaurant job, then the general sentiment is, 
well, you're a failure; versus there are some 
people who do just enjoy it, even with the way 
that people treat it. It's very much if you're 
not working at like a high end place. Then. Yeah, 
you're the failure. And there -- there's not much 
use for you as a person. It's like, well, we're 
still going to restaurants. We still need people 
in these jobs. But they're just not respected and 
I think that's when things that I find extremely 
frustrating because they deserve a lot of 
respect. I think 1, because food service is very 
difficult and very demanding and very emotionally 
draining, but also like I think any type of 
cooking deserves respect because we need to be 
fed. And we don't always want to feed ourselves. 
So we should give respect to the people who are -
- who are doing that, feeding us, and beyond 
that, the people who are providing the 
ingredients for that, like the. Like farm workers 
and specifically like farm laborers, because 
that's a very exploited social class, it's 
basically a slave class in the United States and 
outside of the United States. And our labor laws 
reflect that. You're allowed to be a farm worker, 
I think at the age of like 10, it's either like 
10 or 12.
Adame: Yeah, the child labor laws that were instituted in 
the 30s, I believe, don't apply to farm workers.
McPherson: No, and a lot of those farm workers are Hispanic 
immigrants, well, specifically Latin American 
immigrants. They're not coming from Spain, to 
work on our farms. Yeah, they're Latin immigrants 
and black immigrants. And the main -- one of the 
main reasons those laws were put in place was 
because, or those laws weren't changed, was 
because that's who was doing that job and the 
government and higher classes wanted to keep them 
there, and unfortunately they have. So I think 
those are like, those are probably my big 
frustrations with the food industry, is how 
exploited and looked down upon it is.
Adame: It's like if, unless you're at the very top like 
Gordon Ramsey level. Yeah, you get exploited if 
you're anywhere along the chain.
McPherson: Yes, even. Yeah, like even high-end places, 
you're treated horrifically unless you are the 
Top Chef. Unless you are the person running the 
house. Yeah, and then when you're not in the top 
place, you get treated even worse even if you are 
running the house.
Adame: Yeah. Yeah. No, that's very fair. Part of why I 
wanted to do this interview with you is because 
you're also a historian.
McPherson: Hell yeah, brother. Leave that one in.
Adame: And I know that you understand the historical 
implications of a lot of the food industries --
McPherson: OH, also going back to that, sorry another 
point.
Adame: You're good.
McPherson: Waiting.
Adame: Like waiting tables?
McPherson: Yeah, like waiting tables, those laws and wage 
laws were enacted during reconstruction, like 
those laws have pretty much not changed since 
reconstruction. A big part of that was because 
that was one of the main jobs that newly freed 
slaves were able to take. And the pay even back 
then was d** s*** and it is still absolute d** 
s***. And part of the reason they did that was 
because people didn't have to tip. They did not 
have to pay them. And if it was a -- since it was 
a tip reliant job, the like restaurant owners, 
tavern-like inns, didn't have to pay their staff 
well because like, well, "you clearly did not do 
a good enough job if you didn't get the tips" and 
it was -- that was also a way of, you know, air 
quotes -- heavy air quotes here. "Keeping the 
blacks in their place." Yeah, because that's what 
a lot of food industry laws throughout American 
history have been. It's been about exploitation 
of um, non-respected you know, essentially 
inhuman, yeah. Like social-socioeconomic classes. 
The ones where -- middle one above, again, just 
seen as essentially like non-human. So that's 
another one. Yeah, yeah.
Adame: Onto maybe a bit of a lighter note: what is your 
favorite thing about food service?
McPherson: Really liked eating food. Yeah, that was great. 
Yeah, there is a lot of restaurants and you know 
my non-restaurant and our cafe where you get a 
lot of free stuff or like comped stuff like we 
get a 50% discount.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: And we get at the cafe, the free like small, 
specific drink. And at Nature's Plate we got a 
30% discount and, any food that was expiring, and 
usually our food would stay good. We would mark 
it for a week and it was usually good for 
actually like 8 or 9 days, partly so we could 
pull it back and we could have it, yeah. So we 
ended up taking, we would take home and just eat 
like on our lunch breaks a lot of the expiring 
food. Sometimes there wasn't any which was, on 
one hand, good for business, on the other hand, a 
little disappointing for us because I did not 
want to have to make my food and bring it with me 
every day, so I didn't -- so I did kind of rely 
on those free ones. And one of our former cafe 
workers, the restaurant they worked at, they 
would get like free lunches or free dinners, and 
there's a lot of restaurants who, even if they 
didn't, if they don't offer their workers, like 
free stuff, they will, like comp a lot of meals. 
So I do really like that. Like restaurants, and 
food service places tend to treat -- they tend to 
compensate their employees for how badly we get 
treated.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: So there's that, which is nice.
Adame: Very true. Would you ever like after this job say, 
would you ever go back to working in the food 
industry in any sort of capacity?
McPherson: I would say I would go back to Nature's Plate, 
specifically because I know the job. I know the 
people and, I know that it's something I can do 
and be happy doing for a little while. In general 
though, I would not want to. Because for me it is 
very much a stopgap job in between, um, finishing 
out my degree and going into teaching. I would do 
it if I had to, but that's kind of it. It really 
wouldn't be my main choice ever. Yeah, really. 
Just like if I had to, if I just needed 
something.
Adame: That's very fair. And do you think cooking is a 
natural talent or a born skill? I don't know why 
I phrased it like that. Do you think cooking is a 
natural talent or a gained skill?
McPherson: I think it's both, and I think there's -- I 
think almost everything that people do. There is 
an innate talent to it that people can have, 
whether it's physical stuff like martial arts or 
sports or math, literature. There's an innate 
level of understanding that certain people have 
for each of those things. Uh. And I think cooking 
is the same. I think cooking would be more of 
like a physical innate skill because it has a lot 
to do with your senses but, there's not much you 
can do with it if you don't know -- or if you 
haven't learned how like how to prep things, cook 
times. I think once you know those things, 
talents for like flavor combinations, different 
like timings, different like food combos 
definitely go in, but you do need to have a basis 
for it first. I think that a lot of people have a 
natural curiosity and they can pick those, pick 
up the like basics very quickly and then they can 
explore their innate like gifts with it. Um, so I 
think I do think, it's both, yeah. And I don't 
think you necessarily have to be innately gifted 
or talented to enjoy it or to learn it. I think 
it's something that everybody should learn, at 
least the basics of.
Adame: Yeah.
McPherson: I also think there are people who. Are probably 
talented at it, but don't like it.
Adame: Yeah, that's very fair. Yeah. Do you believe the 
philosophy from Pixar's Ratatouille: anyone can 
cook?
McPherson: I do as stated, yeah.
Adame: OK.
McPherson: I think that talent is found and born anywhere. 
Um you can find somebody who is great at cooking 
and loves cooking from families who don't really 
have a big like food culture within them, I think 
you can get people from foodie families who do 
not give a s***. And yeah, I think talent in 
general can come from anywhere. I think it 
transcends socioeconomics and class structure. 
But unfortunately, because socioeconomics and 
class structure are a thing, a lot of those 
talents don't get fostered where they could, and 
especially because they're valued very 
differently. Like women traditionally are 
expected to cook in home -- at the home, no 
matter what. And that's not a valued skill it's 
an expected skill. Yeah, men could cook, that's 
a, "Oh, OK, neat. Go make that your job." For 
women, they've got to do it no matter what. For 
men, yeah, they can make a job out of it. They 
can make money. Women can't. They have to. 
That's, of course, like changing. There are a lot 
more men who cook just because they like it for 
non-professional reasons. There's plenty of women 
who don't cook because they don't like it or 
because they never learned. I think we find that 
gap narrowing and I think like we're seeing a lot 
more like cooking in general is treated a lot 
more equally. Not like, completely, but it's a -- 
it's a lot more common to see it treated as an 
equal thing. Yeah, which I really like.
Adame: So, when you think of the gender expectations that 
come with cooking, right, like men, it's a very 
valued skill. They should turn into a profession 
and women it's expected, right. And you see, 
like, do you have any first-hand experiences 
witnessing that? In your food service jobs like, 
did you have any female head chefs or anything 
like that?
McPherson: No, mainly because I only worked the two. For us 
at Nature's Plate, our kitchen manager, she was 
actually our house manager, she -- she didn't do 
nearly as much cooking, and because she managed a 
lot of like the front and back stuff, she was 
doing our orders, all that jazz. She was 
definitely one of our better ones. She could whip 
stuff out super fast and well, our other one, 
Keanu. He was a kitchen manager somewhere else. 
So, like, he knew, like, actual like line prep.
Adame: Hmm.
McPherson: So if we were ever behind on anything, we would 
usually get either one of them or both of them to 
start working on everything else. But, no it was 
very like equally valued. I think part of it 
because we were all -- Part of it, I think, was 
because it wasn't an actual restaurant, so I 
mean, none of us were on an actual line. We were 
just given a thing to prep. 
Adame: Yeah. Less of a structured hierarchy. 
McPherson: Yeah exactly. So if you were hired on in the 
kitchen, you were cooking and we would always 
start everybody with the same basic stuff. And we 
would graduate them to the next level of stuff, 
to like actual proper cooking. So everybody was 
treated pretty much the same going into it. Umm, 
our two original owners were also women. And I 
think maybe that did play a part in it because 
they had started the business literally in their 
own kitchens. And they weren't like professional 
cooks or anything. They just started it because 
they liked it. UM. And yeah, we had another man 
who had just been working there forever. So 
everybody kind of defaulted to him to a degree, 
as an authority on like flavor combination and 
stuff, because that was something that he was 
really passionate about and if we needed cooking 
to get done fast, we would go to our two like 
main kitchen managers, which is a man and a 
woman. Um, and then one of our others, who I'm 
still friends with. He was just kind of there to 
put out fires. She was the one who if things got, 
like, messed up she would get everything like 
back on track. So everything was valued pretty 
equally at Nature's plate. I wouldn't even say 
equally. More so as in, it just didn't exist. 
There was no real difference between any of us 
besides experience. So it wasn't even that there 
was equality or equity there, was the -- there 
was just a general hierarchy. And everybody kind 
of fit in at different spots based on like skill 
and experience, which was really nice and I do 
not think that you get that at most actual 
restaurants. Ours was very much unique experience 
because of our structure.
Adame: That's really cool.
McPherson: I liked it. Yeah, it was good.
Adame: What is your favorite Latin American food, dish, 
type of cuisine? What do you gravitate towards 
more usually?
McPherson: Not to be a basic b****, but I love a good 
quesadilla.
Adame: Quesadillas are great.
McPherson: They slap. There -- I haven't had it in a long 
time, but I do also like Venezuelan food. I can't 
remember the stuff that I've had.
Adame: Mhm.
McPherson: I can't remember what it was called. It was 
really good and I think a lot of Latin American 
food and I guess in this particular case, 
Venezuelan food is a good example of being very 
flavorful without like being spicy because you 
know, like Mexican food is known for being pretty 
spicy, or it can be. And I think like one of the 
Western European stereotypes, is like it's not 
spicy and it has no flavor. Which is accurate. 
Whereas there's a lot of Latin American food that 
isn't spicy, but it's still extremely flavorful. 
And that was definitely my experience with 
Venezuelan food. I think part of that is also 
like peppers, and like Latin American peppers, 
because they're not technically peppers, fun 
fact, are only native to, like, I think Southern 
-- it's either central or Southern Mexico, 
Bolivia and Peru. So in a lot of like other 
places besides this, food was never spicy. And I 
don't know how far out, like spicy, like pepper, 
peppery like food culture traveled outside of 
those areas. So there's a lot of, like, Latin 
American food that, again, very flavorful but not 
very spicy. I do love spicy food, though. A lot 
of what I eat is spicy. But yeah I would say 
Venezuelan food and then, quesadillas. I I would 
kill for a um, there's a food truck over at 
Eastside called cheese and salsa. I would kill 
for cheese and salsa pork quesadilla.
Adame: That sounds good. And to sort of wrap things up 
because we have a couple minutes left. What -- 
when you think of Latin American food in the 
United States it can get very politicized, and 
sort of what examples have you seen or like 
witnessed even in like second hand experiences? 
Or just what are your own thoughts on that?
McPherson: I think it's interesting because -- I have a 
thought. I'm trying to figure out how. To word 
the thought. It's one of those things that like 
if -- one of the main things I've seen is, if you 
don't know how to make it, like as somebody from 
Latin America, you're not Latin American. It's, 
not being able to make it, in the eyes of like 
other people, not even other Latin Americans. It 
like completely strips you of your culture, very 
similar to like not being able to speak Spanish, 
or if you're Brazilian, Portuguese.
Adame: Yes.
McPherson: If you don't have that skill, then you're not 
Latin American anymore, you're just American. 
Which -- then you have the cultural and identity 
crisis, because being in America, if you're not 
white and don't -- If you're not white and 
American sounding, um, then, you're still going 
to be othered. So it's one of those things that 
if you don't have either that palette or that 
skill to make it then you're kind of caught in 
between. And then it's also very like gendered, 
because, this is also something with like Italian 
food, not Italian American but like Italian 
proper. And like Korean food, a lot of like big 
cultural cornerstones within their food. Like or 
Italians, the marinara sauce or whatever like, 
red sauce that particular family makes. For 
Korean, it's kimchi. I know in -- for Mexican -- 
Mexico, it's the tamales. A lot of that prep is 
divided by gender, and that is something that, 
you know, we see in a lot of the immigrant 
households as well that gender divide is still 
like adhered to. And on one hand, it does like 
keep that kind of cultural tradition within the 
family, but it's also kind of a familial divide. 
I remember seeing videos of this one -- I think 
it was a Mexican immigrant family, they were 
like, nope, we're all doing it. Husband's 
helping, sons are helping. This is a whole family 
thing. Because I think that also lends itself to 
the like respect that I had talked about earlier. 
How a lot of these things are expected of women, 
but once you get the men involved, there's a lot 
more respect to put to it. So when it becomes a 
whole family thing it's -- it is given more 
respect. But at the same time, it's also very -- 
those things are very much known as like maternal 
bonding moments, like especially in like Korea, 
like the kimchi prep is a huge like bonding 
moment for the women of the family, the mothers, 
the daughters, daughters in law, sisters.
Adame: Yeah. Grandmas.
McPherson: Exactly. So it's -- there's a lot of give and 
take with those things because it's -- on one 
hand, very political in a bigger sense, like 
outside the family like culturally, but even 
within the household, it's -- has its own little 
household politics to it, which I think is very 
interesting to see and it's very complex and as a 
white person of just basic American culture, I 
think it's very easy to look at it and be like 
"Oh well, this is just, like an anti-feminist 
thing" where there -- but there's so much more to 
it.
Adame: So much culture tied into it.
McPherson: Yeah. And it's very complex because again on one 
hand you can say, well, this isn't necessarily a 
respected thing either within or without of the 
household, but it's also, like I said, a huge 
bonding moment and a huge part of culture, you 
know, grandma's tamales, which I have enjoyed 
myself.
Adame: Yeah. Abuelita's tamales, grandma's kimchi, Nonas 
marinara. Yeah, yeah.
McPherson: Exactly. So it's -- there's a lot that goes into 
it, a lot of culture and cultural context that 
goes into it that I can appreciate without 
necessarily fully understanding.
Adame: MHM. Yeah, it's definitely -- even though American 
women are expected to cook for their families, 
sort of in the larger standard, it is definitely 
I think, especially in white families that don't 
have a big cultural connection like to, you know, 
Italian or Greek or whatever, like their previous 
culture, if they don't have a huge connection to 
it, I think there's definitely not as big of a 
relationship to food in general that I think 
especially a lot of Latin American, whether 
they're American immigrants or in their home 
countries is definitely a much bigger thing 
there. That is sort of like, there is a lot of 
respect within the community itself for the 
person that makes that food I think.
McPherson: And something that goes into that specifically 
is it also has to do with experience because, and 
this was also a big thing with Korean cultures, 
like it's not very respected for your young 
married women -- it is expected --
Adame: Mhm.
McPherson: -- but not respected. The respect comes with 
time and age because it's treated, for lack of a 
better term, like a military service, almost. 
You're consigning yourself to it. And once you've 
served your time, you earn that respect. And 
yeah, you definitely see that a lot with the 
Korean culture as well because, yeah, like you 
said, grandma's kimchi. And yeah, it's -- there's 
a lot of respect within the culture for it, but 
it does come with the time you know the -- the 
service put in. But before then, it is very much 
just te thing you're expected to do, yeah, and 
the respect comes later.
Adame: Yeah. Well, awesome. That is a neat and tidy 45 
minutes plus.
McPherson: Plus the other -- plus the other time. Yeah, 
yeah.
Adame: So we'll wrap things up. Thank you so much. I 
appreciate it.
McPherson: You're welcome.
