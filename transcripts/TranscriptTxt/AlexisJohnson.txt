Mykah Stanwood: My name is Mykah Stanwood, and I'm 
interviewing my aunt, Alexis Johnson. It is April 
25th, 2024, around 5:00 PM. OK, first question, 
Auntie, where were you born and where did you 
grow up? 
Alexis Johnson: I was born in New Orleans, LA, and I was 
raised between the Magnolia Project and the 
Melpomene Project. 
Mykah Stanwood: OK. So, when you think of New Orleans, what 
types of foods are you thinking of? Like? What 
types of foods do you think of and associate? 
Alexis Johnson: Soul food. Soul food, seafood, Cajun food -
- they say Cajun, but New Orleans is more home 
soul food. Cajun I think is more further out, 
like Slidell and Mandeville and Lake Charles and 
all them, we're really soul food lovers, yes. 
Mykah Stanwood: So, like growing up, what types of food did 
you eat? 
Alexis Johnson: Girl, we had -- Granny cooked turkey necks, 
smothered chicken, fried chicken, baked chicken, 
collard greens, mustard greens. But Granny really 
cooked mustard greens. She didn't cook collard 
greens they -- she thought collard greens was too 
bitter. 
Stanwood: I agree with her. 
Johnson: And I, but I like them both now, but her majority 
was cooking collard -- I mean mustard greens. And 
she never cooked gumbo. 
Stanwood: She never made them? 
Johnson: But Auntie Anita was the gumbo queen. Like I am 
today. Yes, gumbo we did -- we did like simple 
meals, like daily meals. She would do some 
potatoes with sausage, smothered potatoes and 
sausage with onions. Delicious over rice. She 
would do corn and rice with sausage in it. Back 
then we used to eat pork chops. She would fry 
pork chops or eat the smothered pork chops. What 
else we had? What we never had, was chitlins. 
Yuck! 
Stanwood: I know, that's right. 
Johnson: Hello. No, we never had chitlins. That wasn't our 
deal. Another thing we never had that I hear a 
lot here in Texas -- chicken dumpling. We never 
had that. Yeah, they never had that. But Grandma 
was a famous red bean girl. She did -- she worked 
for the famous restaurant Buster Holmes. So she 
did red beans, white beans, lima beans she did 
different beans. Sweet potatoes? Your dad keeps 
saying no one has never touched his mother's 
sweet potatoes. 
Stanwood: He does say that. 
Johnson: Yes, he, he said, "No, no, no, no." Potato salad 
was another one. She used to cook this meat 
called -- she used to call it seven steaks. 
Stanwood: Seven steaks. 
Johnson: Yeah, that was she called it seven steaks. And the 
baked macaronis that they have today. 
Stanwood: Like the noodle macaroni? 
Johnson: Yeah. Today they you they use the spaghettis. 
Stanwood: Yeah. 
Johnson: Back then, grandmother, your granny used a 
macaroni called spaghetti's number 7. It was a 
little fatter. And girl. Then when I met uncle, 
his mom did the spaghettis. The thin one like 
what was spaghettis. Hers was the bomb too. But 
yeah, that's the kind of food we had. We had 
cereal, we had cereals, but when she did 
breakfast? No one did the grits like she did. Her 
grits, her homemade biscuits. She would have 
sausage. We would have bacon. Different, we would 
have lots of big breakfasts. If we we'll have 
lots of big breakfasts. Scrambled eggs or over 
easy eggs. However you want it, she did it. And 
Grandma had ten of us. Yes 
Stanwood: A lot. 
Johnson: Yes. 
Stanwood: So when you were learning how to cook, did you, 
like, learn from Granny? 
Johnson: Yes. So as a young girl, I always heard them say 
the best way to a man's heart is through his 
stomach, and I took that. I really took that and 
I strive with that. When I was a teenager, I 
wanted to, I told my mom, I said,"I wanna know 
how to cook for my husband." I have to know. So 
me and Auntie Sue was the girls in the kitchen. 
Out of all the sisters, me and Auntie Sue was in 
the kitchen with Granny. We would cut her 
seasoning up, have everything prepped for -- I 
learned from watching Auntie Sue. Oh. And that's 
how I learned to cook. One thing Auntie can't 
cook, can't fry? Chicken. 
Stanwood: Uncle fries the chicken in the house. 
Johnson: Yes, uncle fries the chicken. And you know what, 
Mykah? On Saturdays, Granny didn't cook. Hmm. 
Whatever you can eat, you can eat. Whatever you 
find to eat, that's what you're gonna eat. Granny 
didn't cook on Saturdays. Fridays, we would 
always have fish. 
Stanwood: Was there any reason why she didn't cook on 
Saturdays? 
Johnson: No, that was just her. I guess it was her -- not 
knowing what I know today. You know, because 
today is my Sabbath day. I believe, she didn't 
know, but she just didn't cook. Even uncle's Mom, 
they didn't cook back then on Saturdays. It was 
like a -- they needed a day to rest from cooking. 
They cooked six days a week and then --
Stanwood: It is a lot. 
Johnson: Yes. And Sunday was a big day. Sunday, that's 
where all the food came in -- the ham, turkeys, 
fried chicken, baked macaronis, peas, green beans 
with bacon and potato. Oh girl, yes, yes. 
Stanwood: So do you have like a specific memory that sticks 
out to you growing up, like when it comes to food 
and learning how to cook? Learning how to cook? 
Johnson: Say it again. 
Stanwood: Or like a memory with your sisters of like being 
in --
Johnson: I don't have -- the only memories I have when it -
- I'm the best cook out my sisters. Sorry, I said 
it and I'll say it again. I don't, the only 
memories I do have is me, Auntie Sue, and Granny. 
Because Auntie Sue is like, five years older than 
me, I think. Ah. Oops. 30 No, she's about four 
years older than me, and she was still a young 
girl. No boyfriend or nothing. So. She wanted to 
know, she learned, and so I watched her. That was 
my fun idea. Watching her so as I as she watched 
Granny and she worked with Granny at the 
restaurant, I began to watch them. Yeah, and he 
should work with them. 
Stanwood: The restaurant. 
Johnson: Yeah, Granny worked in Buster Holmes. 
Stanwood: What's that? 
Johnson: It's old, it's a old, old soul food restaurant. If 
you go and Google it, it'll come up. 
Stanwood: Is it still open today? 
Johnson: No, they closed. They went out of business. About 
last year, Susan, Auntie Sue went and pulled up a 
video and Granny was on it. Yeah, working in the 
kitchen. Yes, she was a cook and a waiter. And 
Auntie Sue was waitress. Famous, famous people 
went there to get those red beans every Monday. 
Stanwood: Red beans. 
Johnson: Yes. And I think me, Auntie Kercheryl, and Auntie 
Denise -- I haven't tasted Auntie Lisa, but Lisa 
is a good cook also. But I believe me and Auntie 
Kercheryl have the beans pat down. 
Stanwood: Yes, yes. So, like you mentioned you have so many 
sisters, you have a very large family. What was 
it like having to make food for all that family 
every day? 
Johnson: Listen, Granny had the magnum lite pots. Them big, 
heavy big pots. A big magnum like pot will hold 
turkey necks. That whole pot would be full of 
turkey necks. And I had to learn, too. Coming 
into my family, I only have three sons, so 
raising up my boys, I had to learn. I used to 
cook so much because it was a habit of cooking a 
lot because of all, all of us. So I had to 
graduate to cooking small portions. And it was 
hard. Because I'm used to feeding all these 
people and we always have someone come over, we 
always had a friend somewhere that came over and 
had dinner with us. 
Stanwood: That's nice. 
Johnson: Yes. 
Stanwood: We should start doing that more often, you know. 
Johnson: Yes, we so scattered. Everyone is so scattered 
now. 
Stanwood: Yes, yes. 
Johnson: Yeah, yeah. I had Auntie Denise and Auntie Tracy 
here Sunday. And we had a great time. Yes, we 
don't eat like we used to and let me not forget 
about the ribs, the BBQ. Barbecue ribs, BBQ 
chicken or even BBQ pork chops. Yeah, we didn't 
even try our BBQ turkey necks. Ohh, we done tried 
it all. Yes, I'm sitting here like I forgot about 
the ribs. Yes, we used to have the ribs. 
Stanwood: And you talk a lot about how you used to cook so 
much, but I know nowadays Uncle usually does most 
of the cooking. So, like, how did that happen? 
How did that trade off start basically? 
Johnson: Me telling him I cook too much. It's time for you. 
Uncle is a competitor when it comes to my 
cooking, ha! But now he learned to push back. 
Like, oh, no, he tell everybody. I try to make 
gumbo, but that's her. That's her baby. Yeah. She 
makes a baby. But I guess, so. When I was working 
on the other side of town. Me coming home from 
work tired, busted. And you know he's not 
working. He's retired. He do side works, but he's 
not working like I work. So he cooked more. And 
that's how that kicked in. And he, he could boil 
those crawfish and all that stuff. Potatoes and 
all that that's his real kick. Now, oxtails, we 
didn't start eating oxtails until we came here in 
Texas. 
Stanwood: Hmm. 
Johnson: And that man can cook some oxtails girl. This 
gravy was like, it was, but it's really the 
texture of the oxtails that really makes its own 
gravy. But he still knew how to season it. Ohh my 
goodness, yeah. 
Stanwood: Uncle can cook. 
Johnson: Uncle can cook -- and his meatloaf. I don't even 
try no more. I always try to do meatloaf, never 
could get it. He always done the meatloaf, 
always. He was a meatloaf man and he like hen. We 
used to eat hen -- thinking about the things we 
used to eat. We used to eat hen. He just cooked 
hen two Sundays ago. 
Johnson: And I'm like, who gonna eat all that food? 
Stanwood: Invite me over. 
Johnson: So yeah, what he does, he takes some what he don't 
after we eat. He'll freeze the rest. So we put 
the date on it and put it in a freezer for maybe 
a week or two. Yeah, yeah. 
Stanwood: Uh, Speaking of, like, different things that you 
eat, is there anything that you see in New 
Orleans that like you don't really eat while 
you're here and? Like vice versa. 
Johnson: Po-boys -- 
Stanwood: Po-boys, po-boys. 
Johnson: Po-boys, when I go to New Orleans, things I don't 
eat anymore, I eat it when I go to New Orleans 
cause; It's a po-boy. It's on the po-boy. 
Johnson: I don't eat shrimps, but I would eat shrimps on a 
po-boy. 
Stanwood: MHM. 
Johnson: I would eat oyster. Oyster po-boy, fish sandwich, 
luncheon meat. They say it's the worst, but on 
the po-boy you can't tell. It's just that po-boy, 
man. So here I can't get po-boys. So every time I 
go to New Orleans, there's a place that we stop 
at in Kenner and we get a po boy sandwich. I 
tried the hot sausage. I'll never try it again 
because it's not the true hot sausage that we 
eat. We eat patten hot sausage. They make their 
own, and it's a difference. It's thicker, it's 
not as tasty as the patten hot sausage is. But 
now, Texas gets a lot of New Orleans things. 
Yeah, they have a lot of New Orleans things 
because we're scattered. We're all over and -- 
Stanwood: Yeah. 
Johnson: Now they have to realize that you know, I work 
with Walmart. Walmart had to realize HEB had New 
Orleans food before Walmart. Walmart said, "Wait, 
hold up, we losing our customers!" Yeah, buddy, 
you sure are. You better get that New Orleans, 
the Louisiana food. So Louisiana has its own 
section in Walmart. Yes, when it comes to the 
crawfish boil and all that gumbo mix, okra mix, 
beignets. They have all that in Walmart. 
Stanwood: What was your favorite food growing up? Like if 
Granny made it, you would just ask for it. It's 
like your favorite thing. Like, can you please 
make me that that I love so much or something? 
Johnson: What granny cooked? I loved Granny's meatballs and 
spaghetti. That was one of my favorites. But the 
Macaronis was the top. Nobody still today, nobody 
has made macaroni like my mom. She did the best. 
She would use eggs and milk and butter. Oh my 
goodness. And the spaghettis was -- they were, 
they were like, you know, like the penne? Penne 
spaghetti is what they call them. They was fat 
like that, but they were long. They were number 
7. And you -- I can't find them. My sister say 
they still sell them. No, they don't, girl. I 
can't find them. That was one. And another one? 
And you 'bout to prolly sound like "eugh". Liver. 
Stanwood: Uh. Sorry.
Johnson: I knew you would. Liver and grits. 
Stanwood: Liver, what does liver taste like? 
Johnson: Liver is... I can't tell you. You have to taste 
it. 
Stanwood: Maybe one day if you make it for me, I'll taste 
it. 
Johnson: Yes. Now uncle makes them good, makes it good too. 
I'm not a good liver cooker. Granny made her 
liver, when she did her liver, she smothered her 
liver in gravy. Uncle fries it, saute it with 
green onions and that's it. 
Stanwood: Hmm. 
Johnson: Yes, and he cooked over rice. Both of them. Granny 
did hers with grits. We do here, if we eat it, he 
do it with rice and it's really good. 
Stanwood: You mentioned earlier that you are the gumbo 
queen. How do you make gumbo like when you go to 
the store, what are you looking for? What? What 
are you doing? 
Johnson: Honey. I am really the gumbo queen. Your dad 
turned his work buddies on to me and I make good 
money with them. Ohh yeah, I do gallons. I did my 
last one this year. Last year for the holidays. I 
always make it for the holidays. I make good 
money. Yeah, I'll say that. Yeah, so. The 
shrimps. Now we used to use, my aunt used the 
Blue Crabs. I uses the dungeon crabs and the King 
crabs. I look for the hot sausage. Because we use 
the patent hot sausage and it has to be the link 
so we can squeeze it and roll it in in a ball 
like a meatball. I use -- some people like 
chicken gizzards, some don't. But when I sell it 
I only do hot sausage. I do a smoked sausage to 
my taste. I just found the smoked sausage from a 
guy from Louisiana. He home makes smokes. And 
it's delicious. And when I tell you I bought a 
case for $40. And I think it was probably maybe 
25 long links in there. Yeah. So I look for 
smoked sausage. I get a Dewey sausage sometimes. 
Everybody don't like the Dewey sausage. If you 
don't get the right one and they have too much 
fat in it. But dewey sausage for some reason, 
some of them have a lot of fat and it's not good. 
So you have to really know which one to buy. The 
crabs, the shrimps, crab meat, I put in it. What 
else Some people like chicken, some don't. Some 
people like turkey necks in it, some people 
don't. I might put chicken necks in it, depending 
on who I'm, who want it. Them country boys eat it 
all. Seasoning, I do, red onions, white onions, 
bell Peppers, shallots, the green onions. I use 
onion powder, garlic powder. Bay leaves is the 
number one. Bay leaves make your food pop. Yes. 
Stanwood: That's what dad puts in his spaghetti. 
Johnson: Yes, that bay leaf really make your food pop. What 
else I put in there? Celery. And when I cook it 
for home, it's the same thing. But they like the 
chicken and they want the potato salad. So here I 
use instead of rice, I do potato salad. So I put 
a scoop of potato salad and put a gumbo. Ohh yes. 
Ohh. 
Stanwood: Dad had some leftover gumbo or whatever. It was 
frozen, and he also had some potato salad. And 
like, I like heated up the gumbo. And I was like, 
what if I put it over the potato salad? It was 
delicious. 
Johnson: Delicious, right? I turned my beautician on to it. 
And she was like, girl, I'll never eat gumbo with 
rice again. Yes, it has a good flavor. What I 
say? Bell pepper, shallots, green onions, red 
onions, white onions. I really love the onions. 
Bless you. Cause the white onions got, like a 
sweet taste. And it don't make it sweet, but it's 
not bitter. Celery and the Bay leaves. Salt and 
pepper, cayenne and I try not to use pepper. I'm 
not a black -- I don't like black pepper, so I 
use cognac pepper and I use dill. This is what 
all I put in my gumbo. 
Stanwood: Do you have any dietary restrictions, like 
certain things that you won't eat or you will 
take out of certain recipes? 
Johnson: I don't eat... So today everybody puts shrimps in 
everything. Shrimp and grits, shrimp and mac and 
cheese. Eugh. No, that's not for me. I will not 
put shrimps and I don't eat shrimps. What is it I 
don't put in something? I don't eat pork chops. I 
don't eat -- we try our best to stay. Away from 
pork. Because of the sickness that it brings to 
people body. So, like when I do my beans back 
then Granny used to put pickled pig feet and 
pigtails in it. No, no, no, no, no. Only sausage. 
And if I put meat, it's going to be a smoked 
turkey. I'll boil the turkey, take the skin off 
it and just peel the meat and put the meat in the 
beans. Yeah. So, no pork in no beans. 
Stanwood: Pork. Yeah, I didn't know red beans had pork in 
them until I was looking up ingredients and 
stuff. So, a lot of stuff has pork in it. 
Johnson: Yeah. A lot of stuff has pork in it that we don't 
know of, even candy. 
Stanwood: Yeah, because of the gelatin. Alexis Johnson: 
Yes, so that's why I'm really, I've changed my 
eating habits a lot. Yeah. 
Stanwood: OK, so what advice would you give to someone, 
like me, who is learning how to cook? 
Johnson: Don't use no measuring cups. I've never used -- 
now I'm lying. I'm lying. If I had a recipe from 
someone. But if it's something that I've been 
cooking, I'm not using no measuring cups. You 
know, like they might say 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 
or half. Nah, I just season it to my taste. I 
just put it in there, put it in there. Make sure 
when you're cooking, when, if you using raw meat. 
So say you have chicken. And you're making a 
salad, not a potato salad or garden salad. Don't 
cross contaminate. Even if you cook your chicken 
already and you use your hands with that raw 
chicken. I use gloves. When it comes to me, I try 
my best to use gloves. Wipe down. Wipe, and 
vinegar is a good wipe down substance. People 
don't be like, like I don't use bleach no more, I 
use vinegar cause it whitens. Yeah, you just 
gotta be mindful. How you cook your food too. 
That is, you don't cook it fast. Because when you 
cook, that's what I used to do with chicken. So I 
just discouraged myself. So, I gave it up. I used 
to cook chicken fast, fry chicken fast and it 
would always be half done in the inside. So I 
told my husband you gotta do this chicken cause I 
ain't got it. I can't get it. And so he does it. 
He do the chicken in the garage. He fry the fish 
in the garage. It keeps your house from smelling. 
Stanwood: Hmm.
Johnson: But as you cook, wipe down. Clean, clean as you 
go. Keep yourself from getting sick. 
Stanwood: OK. So when it comes to recipes and certain 
recipes, what types of things do you think I 
should know how to cook? Also, being from New 
Orleans, what things should I always keep with me 
and know how to make? 
Johnson: Red beans. 
Stanwood: Yeah, yeah. 
Johnson: Red beans, that should be your number one go to. 
That's the most, that's, they used to call red 
beans, turkey necks, smothered chicken, poor 
man's meal. They did. They called them poor man's 
meal. Pork and beans and wieners. Yeah. Yeah. 
Poor man. That's the -- corn and smoked sausage. 
Those are poor man meals. Guess what else we used 
to eat? Yellow grits. Poor man meal. I don't know 
where she got them from, but we used to eat 
yellow grits. Poor man's meal. Yes. So fried 
chicken. Baked macaronis. Those, they're easy. 
Very easy. I don't do recipes. I just tell you 
what I put in it. Now talking about measure -- 
this a cup of milk here. No, I ain't doing that. 
I'm gonna just tell you what I -- what I cook. 
Yes, look, LaQuita is a good cook too. Yes, and 
Keisha. Now Keisha, Keisha have a index box. 
Stanwood: Like of recipes? 
Johnson: Mhmm. From all her aunts, she have a meal. She 
have something. She said she have the most from 
me. Oh, and I forgot the roast, cause talking 
about Keisha. That was her number one, the roast, 
the okra and shrimps and sausage. Yeah, all that. 
Keisha, if Keisha call you and ask you how to 
cook something, believe you me she got a pen and 
her index card and she writing it down and she 
putting your name on it. When you go to her 
house, she say, "Look, look what I have? Yeah." 
So just make, you can get you a index box and 
write down, call different one of us you know. 
And Auntie Sue is a good cook also. Now Auntie 
Denise, out of all the sisters, she makes the 
best dressing. 
Stanwood: Dressing? 
Johnson: Yes. She makes it from scratch. She don't use 
jiffy cornbread and all that. And I never asked 
her what she used, but I love -- she make me a 
pan every year. Yes. What else? 
Stanwood: So, thinking of like seasonal foods like for 
holidays and whatnot, what's like your go to 
like, "I know I'm gonna make this for this 
holiday." I know I'm going to do this for this 
holiday. What? Like what are those? 
Johnson: Turkey -- Thanksgiving. We know we're gonna do a 
turkey. 
Stanwood: Right. 
Johnson: But what else can we put with that turkey? So, he 
may do a fried turkey. He'll do a baked turkey 
and a fried turkey. Uncle is good with fried 
turkeys. He'd sell them during that season. So, 
we'll do a turkey, a baked Turkey. I'll bake the 
turkey. He fry the turkey. We do greens. We'll do 
sweet potatoes. We will do baked macaronis, make 
sure we have two sides, peas and string beans, 
cause I'm a string bean lover. I love green 
beans, I love the fat little short ones with 
onions. Make sure we have sweets. We buy that, 
you know. Only cake I ever baked and it's from 
the box, be honest, is the upside down pineapple 
cake cause its his favorite. He love the upside 
down pineapple and his mom used to bake it from 
scratch, and I never got with her on, you know, 
what she did. So I just used the box, me. Quick. 
Yes, so certain holidays, you have certain 
things. So we don't eat ham, so we will never 
have ham. But for Christmas I might make gumbo 
for them. And I may make enough to last them for 
New Years, we'll do, but that's what I did every 
year. New Years I had the largest pot of gumbo 
because we had family over. I would have the 
biggest pot of gumbo that I can make. So it's 
certain years, so, also saying you know, I've 
come away from the holidays so. We may cook the 
beginning of the week and it just carry on, long 
as it don't have seasoning. Not like potato 
salad. Like keep it a day or two, trash it out 
and we want more. We'll make more. But like, if 
we do meat, we can freeze it, we'll pull it out 
the freezer and put it back in the oven. So 
certain things we don't cook in -- a lot of 
things we don't cook no more. 
Stanwood: OK, so like you know, every once in a while when 
the family gets together, you and the aunties are 
all together and y'all are talking about who's 
gonna cook what, what? Who's gonna make this? 
What's like, what's everyone's -- what's their 
dish that when y'all get together, they're gonna 
make this, you know? Someone's gonna make that. 
Johnson: Auntie Tracy stuffed eggs! Girl Auntie Tracy made 
some potato salad and brought it here. Auntie 
Tracy, don't put relish in her potato salad. 
That's not potato salad, sorry. Her potato salad 
just look like potatoes mashed up with eggs and 
mayonnaise. Now. Then she puts some garlic in it. 
And I'm like, you put garlic in potato salad? 
Yeah. So, Auntie Kercheryl would bring the red 
beans. I'mma say Auntie Lisa is -- cause Auntie 
Lisa been in California for years. She will 
probably want us to do her gumbo cause we never 
had her gumbo. And they swear she's a great gumbo 
maker. So I would to ask her for her gumbo. If 
it's a holiday, like around Christmas, 
Thanksgiving, Auntie Denise's stuffing. Auntie 
Tracy, besides stuffed eggs, Auntie Tracy, good 
with the green beans and bacon. And she cuts her 
potatoes up so little and it be perfect. Auntie 
Sue. Ohh my goodness, Auntie Sue would probably 
want to bake the turkey. And let me back up, 
Auntie Denise, even though I don't eat ham, she 
will bring a ham, her and Uncle Steven. Auntie 
Netty? Oh, my goodness, it's been years since 
I've been around Auntie Netty. I... Auntie Netty 
would probably bring the paper plates and stuff. 
Johnson: Yes, when we were young, she used to cook stove 
top stuffing. I hate it. I hate it. So, I don't 
Auntie Netty. I don't, I don't know what she 
cooks. 
Johnson: Auntie Netty? Netty got married and left us, 
Auntie Netty. 
Stanwood: When I lived --
Johnson: Huh? 
Stanwood: When I lived with her, I remember, she used to 
make red beans and rice a lot of times. 
Johnson: OK. So, see, you know red beans and rice. 
Johnson: Who else? Ha! Your dad would try to make the 
meatloaf. Sorry you ain't got it. And the 
meatballs and spaghetti. 
Stanwood: He loves making spaghetti. 
Johnson: Huh? 
Mykah Stanwood: He loves making spaghetti. 
Johnson: He loves making Spaghettis, girl. Think he da 
bomb. Uncle Richard, I don't think cook. I think 
Uncle Richard do more grilling. I think he could 
grill. So he probably would grill and bring some 
ribs. 
Stanwood: Mhm.
Johnson: Me, I can hear Auntie Darlene, "Please have your 
baked macaronis." So, I would do baked macaronis. 
Yeah, I would do baked macaronis and I also would 
do -- there's a dirty rice that Uncle's Mom made. 
And her dirty rice would consist of ground beef, 
hot sausage by patten and rice and shrimps. I 
would make that, your dad love it. Your dad say 
I'm the closest to anybody dirty rice he had 
besides Miss Olivia's. And I will make him some, 
I will make some sweet potatoes because he liked 
my sweet potatoes too. Yeah. 
Stanwood: What else do I have? 
Johnson: What else? 
Stanwood: Hmm. About New Orleans, I know you touched a 
little bit on New Orleans food. 
Johnson: OK. 
Stanwood: But nowadays how much do you identify with New 
Orleans and New Orleans cooking? Like, do you 
think of yourself as a New Orleans chef, because 
I know you don't ever really want to go back to 
live there, but how does New Orleans and New 
Orleans food play into your identity and your 
cooking? 
Johnson: It plays a lot because I mean, that's why I 
learned how to cook. 
Stanwood: MM. 
Johnson: That's the food. That's what really taught me how 
to cook. You know red beans. What kind of 
seasoning to use. Cutting my seasoning up before 
you know, prepping all my stuff before I get it 
together. I mean, so I'm riding in Houston, 
right? And I see a sign saying po-boy. And I say, 
"Lies!" Because so many places I done went to, 
and they say po-boy and they're not po boy. So I 
go there and I'm like, Oh my goodness. And I 
asked them, could I see the bread? They be mad. 
Well, they don't let me see the bread, I leave. 
Stanwood: Oh. 
Johnson: Because po-boy is made on French bread, nothing 
else. Not a what -- what they call that bread? 
The the logies? Noogies? Whatever. Look, that's 
not, that's not po-boy. Now, I did go to an Asian 
restaurant across from my job. 
Stanwood: Oh. Did you have a banh mi? 
Johnson: No. 
Stanwood: They're good. I've heard that. I've heard good 
things about the banh mis. 
Johnson: OK, I can't think the name of it, but it was a 
sandwich. A little short sandwich. Like a po boy. 
And that was the closest. My peer had ordered the 
sandwich and she said, "Try it." And girl when I 
bit down on that bread it was crunchy like the 
French bread. I said, "This French bread!" You 
know, so I can recognize. They'll put even 
seafood. Crawfish I've never seen, we never had, 
we had our crawfish is already boiled. Ain't no 
garlic. I don't know where they get all that from 
-- butter sauce. I don't know where all that 
stuff come from, but that stuff they made-up. But 
that's not the New Orleans style, even with the 
turkey necks. They may do turkey necks and have a 
salsa dip in it. Hmm, no? Yeah. But some of the 
people from New Orleans eat it because that's the 
closest they can get. 
Stanwood: Yeah. 
Johnson: Yeah. So they eat it, but I don't eat the crawfish 
and stuff. 
Stanwood: Yeah. Have you said there's any parts of your 
cooking that you've like compromised? Like maybe 
since you've been out of New Orleans, like, OK, 
maybe some people do this a little bit better. 
Maybe this, maybe I like this way a little bit 
more. 
Johnson: No. 
Stanwood: I thought so. 
Johnson: No. Here, most people love the Hispanic food and I 
like it too. I like the Hispanic food. I went to 
Boudreaux's. Boudreaux's. Even the Popeyes is not 
the same from New Orleans. Yeah. Does that make 
sense? Yeah. Churches. They're not the same. 
Popeyes, for sure, is not the same as it is in 
New Orleans. When you pop open a piece of 
breasts, you're gonna see that Cajun. You're 
gonna see that red, red season. You don't see 
that here. It has the taste, but it doesn't have 
all the seasoning like it has in New Orleans. 
Compromising with? No, because one girl here and 
I'm real close to her, when she do her sweet 
potatoes, they dry. They don't do the -- granny 
did cut the sweet potatoes up, little bitty 
water. Because she say, "Baby, the sugar gonna 
mix this water." So little water, need your 
sugar, your nutmeg, your cinnamon. And with your 
butter, real butter, and at the end. Once it 
cook, you top it off with those marshmallows. 
Stanwood: Marshmallows? 
Johnson: What? 
Stanwood: Ohh, sweet potato. I don't eat sweet potatoe. 
Johnson: Yes! And I watched this girl cooking and it was 
dry. "My granny said you don't need all that 
juice." Girl, that's what makes the sweet 
potatoes. So now there's some soul food 
restaurants. I can say. Yeah. Mickey's, Mickey's 
is one. Mickey's soul food here in Texas, in in 
Houston. I think it's the number one soul food. 
There's another place called Oxtails, now. Her 
sister even have a, they both have restaurants, 
but Mickey's is the top. Yeah. Mickey's... Ohh 
girl and I forgot about the turkey wings. DidI 
say turkey wings, smothered turkey wings? Yes. 
Smothered turkey wings yes. Because I'm looking 
at Mickey's counter with all her food. All the 
food. When you go in the restaurant. When I taste 
her wings, her turkey wings, I thought about mom. 
Yeah, she does them good. She does. And Granny 
used to love Salisbury steaks. Make her own 
Salisbury steak. Uncle make them too. And I never 
tried. Yeah. But. Some things to compromise with, 
no. I cook it the way I cooked it when I was in 
New Orleans. Yeah. 
Stanwood: OK, I guess so growing up, you said you did a lot 
of cooking with Auntie Sue and Granny, but so 
like, what was it like? Like, how did you all get 
your ingredients, when you went to the store -- I 
know there was a lot of you. So were you buying 
in bulk? Was it like you get this, you get this 
you're in charge of this? Yeah. How did you 
afford all that cause? 
Johnson: Granny had everything already. So Granny worked at 
the restaurant, so Granny made tips, good tips, 
real good tips. And Granny would do her grocery 
shopping, and she knew what she needed at all 
times. Like me, I might have to run out, like I 
don't use garlic, I had to go out and get me some 
garlic today. To chew on something because I'm 
dealing with that vertigo and they're saying that 
to chew on some garlic, it'll help. And it's 
really helping me. The popping and stopping all. 
So, I have to -- I might forget something. "Ohh, 
babe, I need you to go get this!" I'll make a 
list. But Granny would have everything, right 
there. Granny would have all her -- so Auntie Sue 
would take everything out she needs. She'll tell 
her what she needs. I need my onions cut up, my 
celery cut up, my green onions cut up, bell -- 
and she would have it separate and clean, washed 
up and Sue just had to cut it up. And we didn't 
use a chopper. I use a chopper. I'm lazy. I use 
the chopper. Granny ain't use no chopper. Granny 
said you better use this knife and cut it up,and 
cut it up fine. Sue is the best cutter, when it 
came to seasoning. When it came to prepping for 
seasoning, call Auntie Sue. Yes, she didn't make 
it bulky. She cut it fine. Because some people 
don't like seasoning, so she would cut it so you 
wouldn't eat it, you wouldn't see it. But we 
didn't, we didn't have no lists. The only time 
Granny made the a list is for the holidays. This 
is, she'll tell us. This is my list. This is what 
I'm gonna have. Granny did all the cooking. 
Granny didn't let, she didn't let us cook for 
holidays. That was her gift to us. She did, and 
we were talking about it Sunday, her last dinner. 
She called us. I want everybody over. Because 
after this, I ain't cooking no more. And she 
ain't cook no more. Then she had a stroke. Yeah. 
So she really didn't cook no more, but it was 
like she knew. But we all went over. I could see 
her sitting in her light, sitting in her light 
little duster, her sitting in the chair. "Now 
it's time for y'all to clean up, clean it up and 
get up outta here. Take it if you're taking in my 
bowls, you better bring it back. And if you take 
it, let me see what you're taking." And she never 
forgot what you took. She didn't write nothing 
down. Yeah, she had kept it in her head. I miss 
my mom. 
Stanwood: I miss her too. 
Johnson: Yeah. 
Stanwood: So are there any things that like for you in the 
kitchen that you really inherited from her? Like, 
do you ever are you ever doing something you 
realize, like, my mom did this? 
Johnson: Girl, when it come to folding my kitchen towels, 
all my towels really. But. Just keeping 
everything, wiping things down. You gotta have 
dish water ready made. You got, you have to have 
that was Granny, you have to have that 
dishwasher, that dishwater. Use a container like 
she used. She used white. I use black cause white 
get dirty fast so I have a container in my sink 
and I keep dishwater ready at all times. I can 
always wash my hands. I can always put my dish 
towel in there and wipe down the counter. Always 
have. Fresh water ready to wipe down. Butter? I 
keep butter. The real butter I keeps. She kept it 
faithful, I keep it faithful. I've gotten away 
from the sugar. I got away from the black pepper. 
She was a lover of black pepper. But she wound up 
having gallstones, and the doctor told us to stop 
giving her black pepper. And that's how I stopped 
using it. But some things, like certain 
seasonings, like SeasonAll, we found out wasn't 
good. So we switched over from that, but that was 
our go to right there. It was a seasoning called 
"All Season". Yes. 
Stanwood: My dad. 
Johnson: Your dad? Your dad have it? 
Stanwood: I think so. I don't know. 
Johnson: Its with a blue tap. 
Stanwood: All season. 
Johnson: Yes, all season. Yes, that was our go to. Having a 
another thing having, bless you. Dish towels 
ready. Always available. Like on the stove 
handle. Putting them dish towels there so I can 
use them. Just little things like that. 
Stanwood: Well, OK. Is there any last things that you want 
to talk about or maybe that were brought up that 
you thought about that you want to talk about? 
Johnson: Granny wasn't a baker. 
Stanwood: Yeah, I didn't know. 
Johnson: No. Yeah, none of us are bakers. The only thing 
grandma made? So ,two things. Peach cobbler. And 
bread pudding. Ohh my. 
Johnson: Granny would save bread. She would go buy French 
bread. They had a French bread bakery everybody 
went to, they just opened back up out there in 
New Orleans. She would buy this bread and let it 
sit and get us to break that bread up, girl. 
Granny bread pudding. Ohh with raisins and that's 
all she put. She didn't put all that other 
pineapple and apple. She did nothing but raisins. 
She had the best bread pudding and her peach 
cobbler. But she wasn't a baker, baker like baked 
homemade cakes and all that. Her sister did that. 
Her sister, Auntie Nita, was more of a gumbo 
baking person because she wasn't a cook like 
Granny. Granny was a cook and I think Granny get 
that from her mom. Because her mother was a cook. 
Both of your great grandparents was good cooks. 
Stanwood: Good to know. I'm sad I didn't catch that. 
Johnson: Yeah. Yes. On our dad's side, his mom's banana 
pudding from, see all that boxed up thing? No, my 
granny did banana pudding straight from the 
straight from the -- homemade. I mean homemade. 
Then we was talking about it and her beans. Every 
Monday. You can go to her and she got red beans 
and banana pudding, every Monday. Never fail. 
Yeah. So we had some pretty good, we had. Back 
then the food was different than it is today. 
Yeah, the food is not the same like it was back 
then. Back then it was clean cut and now they put 
all kind of things in, you know, spraying with 
things. And yeah, people just pushing away from 
it because it's causing a lot of sickness. Yeah, 
but back then shoot, they didn't have all this 
sickness and obesity that they did, like they 
have today. Today, they have a lot of people 
that's obese. You know, and not just, I'm not 
talking about heavy. Somebody like you could be 
really, your waist size may be 130, but you're 
wearing 180. That's obese. You know, so if we 
just push back a little bit, even using salt, a 
different salt, we use different things now. Now 
if I got people coming over and I know these 
people gonna eat, yeah, I'm gonna pull out me 
some red beans. Yeah, I'm gonna cook me some red 
beans, girl, some, and get some grilled, grill me 
some chicken. Let uncle pull the grill out. You 
know, when you have a bulk of people, you know 
what to have. But, in your household -- now is 
different. It's not the same. Yeah, I'm more now, 
I'm on fruits. Yeah, I'm on fruits.
